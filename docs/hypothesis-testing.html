</h1>
<p>In most applied domains, empirical evidences drive the advancement of the field and data from well designed experiments contribute to the built up of science. In order to draw conclusions in favour or against a theory, researchers turn (often unwillingly) to statistics to back up their claims. This has led to the prevalence of the use of the null hypothesis statistical testing (NHST) framework. One important aspect of the reproducibility crisis is the misuse of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-values in journal articles: falsification of a null hypothesis is not enough to provide substantive findings for a theory.</p>
<p>Because introductory statistics course typically present hypothesis tests without giving much thoughts to the underlying construction principles of such procedures, users often have a reductive view of statistics as a catalogue of pre-determined procedures. To make a culinary analogy, users focus on learning recipes rather than trying to understand the basics of cookery. This chapter focuses on understanding of key ideas related to testing.</p>
<div id="sampling-variability" class="section level2" number="2.1">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Sampling variability<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sampling-variability"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>We are typically interested in some characteristic of the population, oftentimes the (conditional) theoretical average of a continuous response variable, denoted <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. This quantity exists, but is unknown to us so the best we can do is estimate it using random samples that are drawn from the population.</p>
<p>We call numerical summaries of the data <strong>statistics</strong>. Its important to distinguish between procedures/formulas and their numerical values. An <strong>estimator</strong> is a rule or formula used to calculate an estimate of some parameter or quantity of interest based on observed data (like a recipe for cake). Once we have observed data we can actually compute the sample mean, that is, we have an estimate — an actual value (the cake). In other words,</p>
<ul>
<li>an estimator is the procedure or formula telling us how to transform the sample data into a numerical summary. Its output is random: even if you repeat a recipe, you won’t get the same exact output everytime.</li>
<li>an estimate is the numerical value obtained once we apply the formula to observed data.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the sample mean of a sample of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\overline{Y}=n^{-1}(Y_1 + \cdots + Y_n)\)</span>. Because the inputs of the function <span class="math inline">\(\overline{Y}\)</span> are random, the estimator <span class="math inline">\(\overline{Y}\)</span> is also random. To illustrate this point, Figure <a href="hypothesis-testing.html#fig:samplevar">2.1</a> shows five simple random samples of size <span class="math inline">\(n=10\)</span> drawn from an hypothetical population with mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, along with their sample mean <span class="math inline">\(\overline{y}\)</span>.</p>

<img src="02-hypothesis_testing_files/figure-html/samplevar-1.png" alt="Five samples of size $n=10$ drawn from a common population with mean $\mu$ (horizontal line). The colored segments show the sample means of each sample." width="85%"><p class="caption">
Figure 2.1: Five samples of size <span class="math inline">\(n=10\)</span> drawn from a common population with mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> (horizontal line). The colored segments show the sample means of each sample.
</p>
</div>
<p>We can clearly see from Figure <a href="hypothesis-testing.html#fig:samplevar">2.1</a> that, even if each sample is drawn from the same population, the sample mean varies from one sample to the next as a result of the sampling variability. The astute eye will also notice that the sample means are less dispersed around <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> than the individual measurements. This is because the sample mean <span class="math inline">\(\overline{Y}\)</span> is based on multiple observations, so there is more information available.</p>
<p>Values of the sample mean don’t tell the whole picture: we must also consider their variability. The sample variance <span class="math inline">\(S_n\)</span> is an estimator of the standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, where <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
S^2_n &amp;= \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i-\overline{X})^2.
\end{align*}\]</span>
The square root of the variance of a statistic is termed <strong>standard error</strong>; it should not be confused with the standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> of the population from which the sample observations <span class="math inline">\(Y_1, \ldots\)</span> are drawn. Both standard deviation and standard error are expressed in the same units as the measurements, so are easier to interpret than variance. Since the standard error is a function of the sample size, it is however good practice to report the estimated standard deviation in reports.</p>
<p>In the next section, we outline how hypothesis testing helps us disentangle the signal from the noise.</p>

</h2>
<p>An hypothesis test is a binary decision rule used to evaluate the statistical evidence provided by a sample to make a decision regarding the underlying population. The main steps involved are:</p>
<ul>
<li>define the model parameters</li>
<li>formulate the alternative and null hypothesis</li>
<li>choose and calculate the test statistic</li>
<li>obtain the null distribution describing the behaviour of the test statistic under <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0\)</span>
</li>
<li>calculate the <em>p</em>-value</li>
<li>conclude (reject or fail to reject <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0\)</span>) in the context of the problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>A good analogy for hypothesis tests is a trial for murder on which you are appointed juror.</p>
<ul>
<li>The judge lets you choose between two mutually exclusive outcome, guilty or not guilty, based on the evidence presented in court.</li>
<li>The presumption of innocence applies and evidences are judged under this optic: are evidence remotely plausible if the person was innocent? The burden of the proof lies with the prosecution to avoid as much as possible judicial errors. The null hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0\)</span> is <em>not guilty</em>, whereas the alternative <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_a\)</span> is <em>guilty</em>. If there is a reasonable doubt, the verdict of the trial will be not guilty.</li>
<li>The test statistic (and the choice of test) represents the summary of the proof. The more overwhelming the evidence, the higher the chance the accused will be declared guilty. The prosecutor chooses the proof so as to best outline this: the choice of evidence (statistic) ultimately will maximize the evidence, which parallels the power of the test.</li>
<li>The null distribution is the benchmark against which to judge the evidence (jurisprudence). Given the proof, what are the odds assuming the person is innocent? Since this is possibly different for every test, it is common to report instead a <em>p</em>-value, which gives the level of evidence on a uniform scale which is most easily interpreted.</li>
<li>The final step is the verdict, a binary decision with outcomes: guilty or not guilty. For an hypothesis test performed at level <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, one would reject (guilty) if the <em>p</em>-value is less than <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>. Even if we declare the person not guilty, this doesn’t mean the defendant is innocent and vice-versa.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Hypothesis<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#hypothesis"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>In statistical tests we have two hypotheses: the null hypothesis (<span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0\)</span>) and the alternative hypothesis (<span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_1\)</span>). Usually, the null hypothesis (the ‘status quo’) is a single numerical value. The alternative is what we’re really interested in testing. In <a href="hypothesis-testing.html#fig:samplevar">2.1</a>, we could consider whether all five groups have the same mean <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \cdots = \mu_5\)</span> against the alternative that at least two of them are different. These two outcomes are mutually exclusive and cover all possible cases. A statistical hypothesis test allows us to decide whether or not our data provides enough evidence to reject <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0\)</span> in favor of <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_1\)</span>, subject to some pre-specified risk of error: while we know that the differences are just due to sampling variability in <a href="hypothesis-testing.html#fig:samplevar">2.1</a> because the data is fake, in practice we need to assess the evidence using a numerical summary.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Test statistic<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#test-statistic"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>A test statistic <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is a function of the data which takes the data as input and outputs a summary of the information contained in the sample for a characteristic of interest, say the population mean. The form of the test statistic is chosen such that we know how it behaves if the null hypothesis is true (e.g., no difference in the overall means of the different groups). In order to assess whether the numerical value for <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is unusual, we need to know what are the potential values taken by <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and their relative probability if <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0\)</span> is true. This allows us to determine what values of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> are likely if <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0\)</span> is true. Many statistics we will consider are of the form<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;This class of statistic, which includes &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(t\)&lt;/span&gt;-tests, are Wald statistics.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>2</sup></a>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
T = \frac{\text{estimated effect}- \text{postulated effect}}{\text{estimated effect variability}} = \frac{\widehat{\theta} - \theta_0}{\mathrm{se}(\widehat{\theta})}
\end{align*}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\theta}\)</span> is an estimator of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\theta_0\)</span> is the postulated value of the parameter and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{se}(\widehat{\theta})\)</span> is an estimator of the standard deviation of the test statistic <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\theta}\)</span>. For example, if we are interested in mean differences between treatment group and control group, denoted <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_0\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\theta = \mu_0-\mu_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0: \mu_0 = \mu_1\)</span> corresponds to <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0: \theta = 0\)</span> for no difference. The numerator would thus consist of the difference in sample means and the denominator the standard error of that quantity, calculated using a software.</p>
<p>For example, to test whether the mean of a population is zero, we set
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\mathscr{H}_0: \mu=0, \qquad  \mathscr{H}_a:\mu \neq 0,
\end{align*}\]</span>
and the usual <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-statistic is
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
T &amp;= \frac{\overline{X}-0}{S_n/\sqrt{n}} \label{ttest}
\end{align}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\overline{X}\)</span> is the sample mean of <span class="math inline">\(X_1, \ldots, X_n\)</span> and the denominator of <a href="#eq:ttest">(<strong>??</strong>)</a> is the standard error of the sample mean, <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{se}(\overline{Y}) = \sigma/\sqrt{n}\)</span>. The precision of the sample mean increases proportionally to the square root of the sample size: the standard error gets halved if we double the number of observations, but only decreases by a factor 10 if we have 100 times more observations. Similar calculations hold for the two-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test, whereby <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\theta} = \overline{Y}_1 - \overline{Y}_0\)</span> for treatment group <span class="math inline">\(T_1\)</span> and control <span class="math inline">\(T_0\)</span>. Assuming equal variance, the denominator is estimated using the pooled variance.</p>

</h3>
<p>The <em>p</em>-value allows us to decide whether the observed value of the test statistic <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is plausible under <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0\)</span>. Specifically, the <em>p</em>-value is the probability that the test statistic is equal or more extreme to the estimate computed from the data, assuming <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0\)</span> is true. Suppose that based on a random sample <span class="math inline">\(X_1, \ldots, X_n\)</span> we obtain a statistic whose value <span class="math inline">\(T=t\)</span>. For a two-sided test <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0:\theta=\theta_0\)</span> vs. <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_a:\theta \neq \theta_0\)</span>, the <em>p</em>-value is <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{Pr}_0(|T| \geq |t|)\)</span>. If the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is symmetric around zero, the <em>p</em>-value is
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
p = 2 \times \mathsf{Pr}_0(T \geq |t|).
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>How do we determine the null distribution given that the true data generating mechanism is unknown to us? In simple cases, it might be possible to enumerate all possible outcomes and thus quantity the degree of outlyingness of our observed statistic. In more general settings, we can resort to simulations or to probability theory: the central limit theorem says that the tell us that the sample mean behaves like a normal random variable with mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma/\sqrt{n}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> large enough. The central limit theorem has broader applications since it applies to any average, and we it can be use to derive benchmarks for most commonly used statistics in large samples. Most software use these approximations as proxy by default: the normal, Student’s <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> distributions are the reference distributions that arise the most often.</p>

<p>There are generally three ways of obtaining null distributions for assessing the degree of evidence against the null hypothesis</p>
<ul>
<li>exact calculations</li>
<li>large sample theory (aka ‘asymptotics’ in statistical lingo)</li>
<li>simulation</li>
</ul>
<p>While desirable, the first method is only applicable in simple cases (such as counting the probability of getting two six if you throw two fair die). The second method is most commonly used due to its generality and ease of use (particularly in older times where computing power was scarce), but fares poorly with small sample sizes (where ‘too small’ is context and test-dependent). The last approach can be used to approximate the null distribution in many scenarios, but adds a layer of randomness and the extra computations costs sometimes are not worth it.</p>

</h3>
<p>The <em>p</em>-value allows us to make a decision about the null hypothesis. If <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0\)</span> is true, the <em>p</em>-value follows a uniform distribution, as shown in Figure <a href="hypothesis-testing.html#fig:power-plots">2.2</a>. <a href="https://xkcd.com/1478/">Thus, if the <em>p</em>-value is small</a>, this means observing an outcome more extreme than <span class="math inline">\(T=t\)</span> is unlikely, and so we’re inclined to think that <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0\)</span> is not true. There’s always some underlying risk that we’re making a mistake when we make a decision. In statistic, there are <a href="https://xkcd.com/2303/">two type of errors</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>type I error: we reject <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0\)</span> is true,</li>
<li>type II error: we fail to reject <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The two hypothesis are not judged equally: we seek to avoid error of type I (judicial errors, corresponding to condamning an innocent). To prevent this, we fix a the level of the test, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, which captures our tolerance to the risk of commiting a type I error: the higher the level of the test <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, the more often we will reject the null hypothesis when the latter is true. The value of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in (0, 1)\)</span> is the probability of rejecting <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0\)</span> is in fact true,
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\alpha = \mathsf{Pr}_0\left(\text{ reject } \mathscr{H}_0\right).
\end{align*}\]</span>
The level <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is fixed beforehand, typically <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>%, <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>% or <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>%. Keep in mind that the probability of type I error is <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> only if the null model for <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0\)</span> is correct (sic) and correspond to the data generating mechanism.</p>
<p>The focus on type I error is best understood by thinking about costs of moving away from the status quo: a new website design or branding will be costly to implement, so you want to make sure there are enough evidence that the proposal is the better alternative and will lead to increased traffic or revenues.</p>

The experiment took place in 1972 and the experimental units, which consisted of 95 male bank supervisors, were submitted to various memorandums and asked to provide ratings or decisions based on the information provided.</p>
<p>We are interested in Experiment 1 related to promotion of employees: managers were requested to decide on whether or not to promote an employee to become branch manager based on recommendations and ratings on potential for customer and employee relations. The authors intervention focused on the description of the nature (complexity) of the manager’s job (either simple or complex) and the sex of the candidate (male or female): all files were similar otherwise.</p>
<p>The authors played with two factors: nature (complexity) of the manager’s job (either simple or complex) and the sex of the candidate (male or female): all files were similar otherwise.</p>
<p>We consider for simplicity only sex as a factor and aggregate over job for the <span class="math inline">\(n=93\)</span> replies. Table <a href="hypothesis-testing.html#tab:rosen-table1">2.1</a> shows the counts for each possibility.</p>

<p>The null hypothesis of interest here that sex has no impact, so the probability of promotion is the same for men and women. Let <span class="math inline">\(p_{\text{m}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_{\text{w}}\)</span> denote these respective probabilities; we can thus write mathematically the null hypothesis as <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0: p_{\text{m}} = p_{\text{w}}\)</span> against the alternative <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_a: p_{\text{m}} \neq p_{\text{w}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The test statistic typically employed for two by two contingency tables is a chi-square test<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;If you have taken advanced modelling courses, this is a score test obtained by fitting a Poisson regression with &lt;code&gt;sex&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;action&lt;/code&gt; as covariates; the null hypothesis corresponding to lack of interaction term between the two.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a>, which compares the overall proportions of promoted to that in for each subgroup. The sample proportion for male is 32/42 = ~76%, compared to 19/49 or ~49% for female — note that these are sample averages if we set <code>promote=1</code> and <code>hold file=0</code>. While it seems that this difference of 16% is large, it could be spurious: the standard error for the sample proportions is roughly 3.2% for male and 3.4% for female.</p>
<p>If there was no discrimination based on sex, we would expect the proportion of people promoted to be the same overall; this is 51/93 =0.55 for the pooled sample. We could simply do a test for the mean difference, but rely instead on the chi-square test, which compares the expected counts (based on equal promotion rates) to the observed counts, suitably standardized. If the discrepancy is large between expected and observed, than this casts doubt on the validity of the null hypothesis.</p>

<p>If the counts of each cell are large, the null distribution of the chi-square test is well approximated by a <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> distribution. The output of the test includes the value of the statistic, the degrees of freedom of the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> approximation and the <em>p</em>-value, which gives the probability that a random draw from a <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2_1\)</span> distribution is larger than the observed test statistic <strong>assuming the null hypothesis is true</strong>. The <em>p</em>-value is very small, 0.001, which means such a result is quite unlikely to happen by chance if there was no sex-discrimination.</p>
<p>There are alternative test statistics that could be used, among which the odds ratio. The odds of an event is the ratio of the number of success over failure: in our example, this would be the number of promoted over held files. The odds of promotion for male is 32/12, whereas that of female is 19/30. The odds ratio for male versus female is thus <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{OR}=\)</span> (32/12) / (19/30)= 4.21. Under the null hypothesis, <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0: \mathsf{OR}=\)</span> 1 (same probability of being promoted) (why?)</p>
<p>Fisher’s test assumes that the row and sum totals are fixed (that is, the number of promoted/withheld files and male/female are fixed at the design stage) and uses this to derive the exact probability of observing this particular configuration if the proportion of success was the same. The test statistic for Fisher’s exact test, obtained by running <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/fisher.test.html">fisher.test(dat_exper1)</a></code>, is different but so is the null distribution<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;The null distribution for Fisher’s exact test is hypergeometric. This fact is well known in combinatorics, also known as the art of counting marbles.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a>.

<p>In the first experiment, managers were also asked to rank applications on their potential for both employee and customer relations using a Likert scale of six items ranging from (1) extremely unfavorable to (6) extremely favorable.

<p>In itself, this information isn’t sufficient: we don’t know the test used, and more importantly the degrees of freedom (80) are much too few compared to the number of observations, implying non-response that isn’t discussed elsewhere.</p>

There are many improvements that would have possible in the presentation, including explicitly stating which test statistic is employed (the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> value seemingly doesn’t correspond to the chi-square test or is incorrectly reported), providing the sample size, means variance estimates, the null distribution and its parameters, if any.

<p>There are two sides to an hypothesis test: either we want to show it is not unreasonable to assume the null hypothesis, or else we want to show beyond reasonable doubt that a difference or effect is significative: for example, one could wish to demonstrate that a new website design (alternative hypothesis) leads to a significant increase in sales relative to the status quo. Our ability to detect these improvements and make discoveries depends on the power of the test: the larger the power, the greater our ability to reject <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0\)</span> when the latter is false. The power summarizes the level of evidence for various combination of parameters (effect size, variability, sample size).</p>
<p>Failing to reject <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_a\)</span> is true (not guilty verdict of a criminal) corresponds to the definition of type II error, the probability of which is <span class="math inline">\(1-\gamma\)</span>, say. The <strong>power of a test</strong> is the probability of <strong>correctly</strong> rejecting <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0\)</span> is false, i.e.,
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\gamma = \mathsf{Pr}_a(\text{reject} \mathscr{H}_0)
\end{align*}\]</span>
Depending on the alternative models, it is more or less easy to detect that the null hypothesis is false and reject in favor of an alternative.
Power is thus a measure of our ability to detect real effects.</p>

<p>We want to choose an experimental design and a test statistic that leads to high power, so that <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is as close as possible to one.

Power depends on many criteria, notably</p>
<ul>
<li>the effect size: the bigger the difference between the postulated value for <span class="math inline">\(\theta_0\)</span> under <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0\)</span> and the observed behaviour, the easier it is to departures from <span class="math inline">\(\theta_0\)</span>.
(Figure <a href="hypothesis-testing.html#fig:power3">2.6</a>); it’s easier to spot an elephant in a room than a mouse.</li>
<li>variability: the less noisy your data, the easier it is to detect differences between the curves (big differences are easier to spot, as Figure <a href="hypothesis-testing.html#fig:power2">2.5</a> shows);</li>
<li>the sample size: the more observation, the higher our ability to detect significative differences because the standard error decreases with sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> at a rate (typically) of <span class="math inline">\(n^{-1/2}\)</span>. The null distribution also becomes more concentrated as the sample size increase. In experimental designs, power may be maximized by specifying different sample size in each group</li>
<li>the choice of test statistic: for example, rank-based statistics discard information about the observed values of the response, focusing instead on their relative ranking. While the resulting tests are typically less powerful, they are more robust to model misspecification and outliers.</li>
</ul>
<p>To calculate the power of a test, we need to single out a specific alternative hypothesis. In very special case, analytic derivations are possible. For a given alternative, we</p>
<ul>
<li>simulate repeatedly samples from the model from the hypothetical alternative world</li>
<li>we compute the test statistic for each of these new samples</li>
<li>we transform these to the associated <em>p</em>-values based on the postulated null hypothesis.</li>

<p>A <strong>confidence interval</strong> is an alternative way to present the conclusions of an hypothesis test performed at significance level <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>. It is often combined with a point estimator <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\theta}\)</span> to give an indication of the variability of the estimation procedure. Wald-based <span class="math inline">\((1-\alpha)\)</span> confidence intervals for a parameter <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> are of the form
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}

\end{align*}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{q}_{\alpha/2}\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(1-\alpha/2\)</span> quantile of the null distribution of the Wald statistic
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
T =\frac{\widehat{\theta}-\theta}{\mathrm{se}(\widehat{\theta})},
\end{align*}\]</span>
and where <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> represents the postulated value for the fixed, but unknown value of the parameter. The bounds of the confidence intervals are random variables, since both estimators of the parameter and its standard error, <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\theta}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{se}(\widehat{\theta})\)</span>, are random variables: their values will vary from one sample to the next.</p>

where <span class="math inline">\(t_{n-1,\alpha/2}\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(1-\alpha/2\)</span> quantile of a Student-<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distribution with <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>Before the interval is calculated, there is a <span class="math inline">\(1-\alpha\)</span> probability that <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is contained in the <strong>random</strong> interval <span class="math inline">\((\widehat{\theta} - \mathfrak{q}_{\alpha/2} \; \mathrm{se}(\widehat{\theta}), \widehat{\theta} + \mathfrak{q}_{\alpha/2} \; \mathrm{se}(\widehat{\theta}))\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\theta}\)</span> denotes the estimator. Once we obtain a sample and calculate the confidence interval, there is no more notion of probability: the true value of the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is either in the confidence interval or not. We can interpret confidence interval’s as follows: if we were to repeat the experiment multiple times, and calculate a <span class="math inline">\(1-\alpha\)</span> confidence interval each time, then roughly <span class="math inline">\(1-\alpha\)</span> of the calculated confidence intervals would contain the true value of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> in repeated samples (in the same way, if you flip a coin, there is roughly a 50-50 chance of getting heads or tails, but any outcome will be either). Our confidence is in the <em>procedure</em> we use to calculate confidence intervals and not in the actual values we obtain from a sample.</p>

<p>If we are only interested in the binary decision rule reject/fail to reject <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0\)</span>, the confidence interval is equivalent to a <em>p</em>-value since it leads to the same conclusion. Whereas the <span class="math inline">\(1-\alpha\)</span> confidence interval gives the set of all values for which the test statistic doesn’t provide enough evidence to reject <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0\)</span> at level <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, the <em>p</em>-value gives the probability under the null of obtaining a result more extreme than the postulated value and so is more precise for this particular value. If the <em>p</em>-value is smaller than <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, our null value <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> will be outside of the confidence interval and vice-versa.</p>
