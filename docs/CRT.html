<p>This chapter focuses on experiments where potentially multiple factors of interest are manipulated by the experimenter to study their impact. If the allocation of observational units to each treatment combination is completely random, the resulting experiment is a completely randomized design.</p>
<p>Most of the time, we will be interest in comparing the average response for each treatment combination: this underlies the analysis of variance model.</p>
<p>The objective is to present some of the basic concepts surrounding hypothesis test, model validation, multiple testing, the interplay between power, effect size and sample size, etc. with the easiest possible model to build intuition for these concepts. They are readily generalized to more complicated linear models.</p>
<p>The one-way analysis of variance describes the most simple experimental setup one can consider: completely randomized experiments with one factor, in which we are solely interested in the effect of a single treatment variable with multiple levels.</p>
<p>The focus is on comparisons of the average of a single outcome variable with <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> different treatments levels, each defining a sub-population differing only in the treatment they received.</p>
<div id="one-way-analysis-of-variance" class="section level2" number="3.1">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> One-way analysis of variance<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#one-way-analysis-of-variance"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>A <strong>one-way analysis of variance</strong> compares the sample averages of each treatment group <span class="math inline">\(T_1, \ldots, T_K\)</span> to try and determine if the population averages could be the same. Since we have <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> groups, there will be <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> averages (one per group) to estimate.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1, \ldots, \mu_K\)</span> denote the theoretical (unknown) mean (aka expectation) of each of the <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> sub-populations defined by the different treatments. Lack of difference between treatments is equivalent to equality of means, which translates into the hypotheses
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\mathscr{H}_0: &amp; \mu_1 = \cdots = \mu_K \\
\mathscr{H}_a: &amp; \text{at least two treatments have different averages, }
\end{align*}\]</span>
The null hypothesis is, as usual, a single numerical value, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. The alternative consists of all potential scenarios for which not all expectations are equal. Going from <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> averages to one requires imposing <span class="math inline">\(K-1\)</span> restrictions (the number of equality signs), as the value of the global mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is left unspecified.</p>
<div id="parametrizations-and-contrasts" class="section level3" number="3.1.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Parametrizations and contrasts<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#parametrizations-and-contrasts"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The most natural parametrization is in terms of group averages: the (theoretical unknown) average for treatment <span class="math inline">\(T_j\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\mu_j\)</span>, so we obtain <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> parameters <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1, \ldots, \mu_K\)</span> whose estimates are the sample averages <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\mu}_1, \ldots, \widehat{\mu}_K\)</span>. One slight complication arising from the above is that the values of the population average are unknown, so this formulation is ill-suited for hypothesis testing because none of the <span class="math inline">\(\mu_i\)</span> values are known in practice and we need to make comparisons in terms of a known numerical value.</p>
<p>The most common parametrization is in terms of <strong>constrasts</strong> (or mean differences) relative to a reference group (say <span class="math inline">\(T_1\)</span>). The theoretical average of each group is written as <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1 + a_i\)</span> for treatment <span class="math inline">\(T_i\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(a_1=0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(T_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a_i = \mu_i-\mu_1\)</span> otherwise. The parameters are <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1, a_2, \ldots, a_K\)</span>.</p>
<p>An equivalent formulation writes for each treatment group the average of subpopulation <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\mu_j = \mu + \delta_j\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\delta_j\)</span> is the difference between the treatment average <span class="math inline">\(\mu_j\)</span> and the global average of all groups. Imposing the constraint <span class="math inline">\(\delta_1 + \cdots + \delta_K=0\)</span> ensures that the average of effects equals <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. Thus, if we know any <span class="math inline">\(K-1\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\{\delta_1, \ldots, \delta_K\}\)</span>, we automatically can deduce the last one.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unlabeled-div-11" class="example"><strong>Example 3.1  (Impact of encouragement on teaching) </strong></span>In <strong>R</strong>, the <code>lm</code> function fits a linear model based on a formula of the form <code>response ~ explanatory</code>. If the explanatory is categorical (i.e., a factor), the parameters of this model are the intercept, which is the sample average of the baseline group and the other parameters are simply contrasts, i.e., the <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span>âs.</p>
<p>The sum-to-zero parametrization is obtained with <code>contrasts = list(... = contr.sum)</code>, where the ellipsis is replaced by the name of the categorical variable; an easier alternative is <code>aov</code>, which enforces this parametrization by default. With the sum-to-zero parametrization, the intercept is the average of each treatment average, <span class="math inline">\((\widehat{\mu}_1 + \cdots + \widehat{\mu}_5)/5\)</span>; this need not coincide with the (overall) mean of the response <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\mu} = \overline{y}\)</span> unless the sample the number of observations in each group is the same.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;We say a sample is balanced if each (sub)group contains the same number of observations.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> The other coefficients of the sum-to-zero parametrization are the differences between this intercept and the group means.</p>
<p>We show the function call to fit a one-way ANOVA in the different parametrizations along with the sample average of each arithmetic group (the two controls who were taught separately and the groups that were praised, reproved and ignored in the third class). Note that the omitted category changes depending on the parametrization.</p>

<p>We can still assess the hypothesis by comparing the sample means in each group, which are noisy estimates of the expectation: their inherent variability will limit our ability to detect differences in mean if the signal-to-noise ratio is small.</p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> Sum of squares decomposition<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sum-of-squares-decomposition"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The following section can be safely skipped on first reading: it attempts to shed some light into how the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-test statistic works as a summary of evidence: it isnât straightforward in the way it appears.</p>
<p>The usual notation for the sum of squares decomposition is as follows: suppose <span class="math inline">\(y_{ik}\)</span> represents the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th person in the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>th treatment group (<span class="math inline">\(k=1, \ldots, K\)</span>) and the sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> can be split between groups as <span class="math inline">\(n_1, \ldots, n_K\)</span>; in the case of a balanced sample, <span class="math inline">\(n_1=\cdots=n_K = n/K\)</span>. We denote by <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\mu}_k\)</span> the sample average in group <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\mu}\)</span> the overall average <span class="math inline">\((y_{11} + \cdots + y_{n_KK})/n = \sum_k \sum_i y_{ik}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\sum_i\)</span> denotes the sum over all individuals in the group.
Under the null model, all groups have the same mean, so the natural estimator is the sample average <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\mu}\)</span> and likewise the group averages <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\mu}_1, \ldots, \widehat{\mu}_K\)</span> are the correct estimators if each group has a (potentially) different mean. The more complex, which has more parameters, will always fit better because it has more possibility to accommodate differences observed in a group, even if these are spurious.
The sum of squares measures the (squared) distance between the observation and the fitted values, with the terminology total, within and between sum of squares linked to the decomposition
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\underset{\text{total sum of squares} }{\sum_{i}\sum_{k} (y_{ik} - \widehat{\mu})^2} &amp;= \underset{\text{within sum of squares} }{\sum_i \sum_k (y_{ik} - \widehat{\mu}_k)^2} +  \underset{\text{between sum of squares} }{\sum_k n_i (\widehat{\mu}_k - \widehat{\mu})^2}.
\end{align*}\]</span>
The term on the left is a measure of the variability for the null model <span class="math inline">\((\mu_1 = \cdots = \mu_K)\)</span> under which all observations are predicted by the overall average <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\mu}\)</span>. The within sum of squares measures the distance between observations and their group mean, which describes the alternative model in which each group has (potentially) a different average, but the same variability.</p>
<p>We can measure how much worst we do with the alternative model (different average per group) relative to the null by calculating the between sum of square. This quantity in itself varies with the sample size (the more observations, the larger it is) so we must standardize as usual this quantity so that we have a suitable benchmark.</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-statistic is
<span class="math display" id="eq:Fstatheuristic">\[\begin{align}
F &amp;= \frac{\text{between-group variability}}{\text{within-group variability}} \\&amp;= \frac{\text{between sum of squares}/(K-1)}{\text{within sum of squares}/(n-K)}
\tag{3.1}
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>Heuristically, if there is no mean difference (null hypothesis), the numerator is an estimator of the population variance, and so is the denominator of <a href="CRT.html#eq:Fstatheuristic">(3.1)</a>. If there are many observations (and relatively fewer groups), the ratio in eq.<a href="CRT.html#eq:Fstatheuristic">(3.1)</a> is approximately one on average and, for large enough sample, the null distribution of the <em>F</em>-statistic is approximately an <em>F</em>-distribution, whose shape is governed by two parameters named degrees of freedom which appear in eq.<a href="CRT.html#eq:Fstatheuristic">(3.1)</a> as scaling factors to ensure proper standardization. The first is the number of restrictions imposed by the null hypothesis (<span class="math inline">\(K-1\)</span>, the number of groups minus one for the one-way analysis of variance), and the second is the number of observations minus the number of <em>parameters estimates</em> for the mean (<span class="math inline">\(n-K\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the overall sample size and <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is the number of groups).<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;There are only &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(K\)&lt;/span&gt; parameter estimates for the mean, since the overall mean is full determined by the other averages with &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n\widehat{\mu} =n_1\widehat{\mu}_1 + \cdots + n_K \widehat{\mu}_K\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Figure <a href="CRT.html#fig:squareddistanova">3.1</a> shows how the difference between these distances can encompass information that the null is wrong. The sum of squares is obtained by computing the squared length of these vectors and adding them up. The left panel shows strong signal-to-noise ratio, so that, on average, the black segments are much longer than the colored ones. This indicates that the model obtained by letting each group have its own mean is much better than the other. The picture in the right panel is not as clear: on average, the colored arrows are shorter, but the difference in length is much smaller relative to the colored arrows.</p>

<p>How reliable is the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-statistic approximation? We can assess this by simulating from the null model, repeatedly drawing samples with similar characteristics (same mean and overall variance) and computing the test statistic on each replicate. However, we only have one sample at hand so this little numerical exercise wouldnât work in practice.</p>
<p>If the distributions are the same under the null and alternative except for a location shift, we could instead resort to a permutation-based approach to <a href="https://www.jwilber.me/permutationtest/">generate those alternative samples by simply shuffling the labels</a>. We see in Figure <a href="CRT.html#fig:Fdistpermut">3.2</a> that the histogram of the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-statistic values obtained from 10 000 permutations closely matches that of the large-sample <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-distribution when there are on average 20 observations per group (right). However, with smaller samples (left), the theoretical null is underdispersed relative to the permutation based distribution, and the latter should be viewed as more accurate in this setting.</p>

<p>How to represent data in a publication? The purpose of the visualization is to provide intuition that extends beyond the reported descriptive statistics and to check the model assumptions. Most of the time, we will be interested in averages and dispersion, but plotting the raw data can be insightful. It is also important to keep in mind that summary statistics are estimators of population quantities that are perhaps unreliable (much too variable) in small samples to be meaningful quantities. Since the mean estimates will likely be reported in the text, the graphics should be used to convey additional information about the data. If the samples are extremely large, then graphics will be typically be used to present salient features of the distributions.</p>

<p>In a one-way analysis of variance, the outcome is a continuous numerical variable, whereas the treatment or explanatory is a categorical variable. Basic graphics include dot plots, histograms and density plots, or rugs for the raw data. We can produce one such graph for each level of the factor.</p>
<p>Scatterplots are not a good option because observations get overlaid. There are multiple workarounds, involving transparency, bubble plots for discrete data with ties, adding noise (jitter) to every observation or drawing values using a thin line if the data are continuous.</p>
<p>Journals are plagued with poor visualisations, a prime example of which is the infamous <a href="https://simplystatistics.org/2019/02/21/dynamite-plots-must-die/">dynamite plot</a>: it consists of a bar plot with one standard error interval. The problem with this (or with other summary statistics) is that they hide precious information about the spread and values taken by the data, as many different data could give rise to the same average while being quite different in nature. The height of the bar is the sample average and the bars extend beyond one standard error: this makes little sense as we end up comparing areas, whereas the mean is a single number. The right panel of Figure <a href="CRT.html#fig:dynamiteplot">3.3</a> shows instead a dot plot for the data, i.e., sample values with ties stacked for clarity, along with the sample average and a 95% confidence interval for the latter as a line underneath. In this example, there are not enough observations per group to produce histograms: a summary of nine numbers isnât really needed. <span class="citation">Weissgerber et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Weissgerber:2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> discusses alternative solutions and can be referenced when fighting reviewers who insist on bad visualizations.</p>
<p>If we have a lot of data, it sometimes help to represent selected summary statistics or group data. A box-and-whiskers plot (or boxplot) is a commonly used graphic representing the whole data distribution using five numbers</p>
<ul>
<li>The box gives the quartiles, say <span class="math inline">\(q_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(q_2\)</span> (median) and <span class="math inline">\(q_3\)</span> of the distribution: 50% of the observations are smaller or larger than <span class="math inline">\(q_2\)</span>, 25% are smaller than <span class="math inline">\(q_1\)</span> and 75% are smaller than <span class="math inline">\(q_3\)</span> for the sample.</li>
<li>The whiskers extend up to <span class="math inline">\(1.5\)</span> times the box width (<span class="math inline">\(q_3-q_1\)</span>) (so the largest observation that is smaller than <span class="math inline">\(q_3+1.5(q_3-q_1)\)</span>, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Observations beyond the whiskers are represented by dots or circles, sometimes termed outliers. However, beware of this terminology: the larger the sample size, the more values will fall outside the whiskers (about 0.7% for normal data). This is a drawback of boxplots, which were conceived at a time where big data didnât exist. If you want to combine boxplots with the raw data, remove the display of outliers to avoid artefacts.</p>

<p>If the global test of equality of mean for the one-way ANOVA leads to rejection of the null, the conclusion is that one of the group has a different mean. However, the test does not indicate which of the groups differ from the rest nor does it say how many are different. There are different options: one is custom contrasts, a special instance of which is pairwise comparisons.</p>
<p>We are interested in looking at the difference between the (population) average of group <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, say. The null hypothesis of no difference translate into <span class="math inline">\(\mu_i-\mu_j=0\)</span>, so the numerator of our statistic will be the estimator <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\mu}_i - \widehat{\mu}_j\)</span> of the difference in sample mean, minus zero.</p>
<p>Assuming equal variances, the two-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test statistic is
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
t_{ij} = \frac{(\widehat{\mu}_i - \widehat{\mu}_j) - 0}{\mathsf{se}(\widehat{\mu}_i - \widehat{\mu}_j)} =\frac{\widehat{\mu}_i - \widehat{\mu}_j}{\widehat{\sigma} \left(\frac{1}{n_i} + \frac{1}{n_j}\right)^{1/2}},

where <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\mu}_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n_i\)</span> are respectively the sample average and the number of observations of group <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\sigma}\)</span> is the estimator of the standard deviation derived using the whole sample (assuming equal variance). As usual, the denominator of <span class="math inline">\(t_{ij}\)</span> is the standard error of the <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\mu}_i - \widehat{\mu}_j\)</span>, whose postulated difference is zero. We can compare the value of the observed statistic to a Student-<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distribution with <span class="math inline">\(n-K\)</span> degrees of freedom, denoted <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{St}(n-K)\)</span>.

</h2>
<p>So far, we have brushed all of the model assumptions under the carpet. These are necessary requirements for the inference to be valid: any statement related to <em>p</em>-values, etc. will approximately hold only if a set of assumptions is met in the first place. This section is devoted to the discussion of these assumptions, showcasing examples of where things can go wrong.</p>
<p>The basic assumption of most designs is that we can decompose the outcome into two components <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Cox:1958" role="doc-biblioref">Cox 1958</a>)</span>
<span class="math display" id="eq:additive">\[\begin{align}
\begin{pmatrix} \text{quantity depending} \\
\text{on the treatment used}\end{pmatrix} +
\begin{pmatrix} \text{quantity depending only } \\
\text{on the particular unit}
\end{pmatrix}
\tag{3.2}
\end{align}\]</span>
This <strong>additive</strong> decomposition further assumes that each unit is unaffected by the treatment of the other units and that the average effect of the treatment is constant. Thus, it is justified to use difference in sample mean to estimate the treatment effect since on average, the individual effect is zero.</p>
<p>It is customary to write the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th observation of the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>th group in the one-way analysis of variance model as
<span class="math inline">\(Y_{ik} = \mu_k + \varepsilon_{ik}\)</span>,
where the error term, which accounts for unexplained variability and individual differences, has mean zero and variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>. Many graphical diagnostics use residuals, i.e., some variant of the observations minus the group mean <span class="math inline">\(y_{ik} - \widehat{\mu}_k\)</span>, to look for violation of the assumptions.</p>

</div>
<p>More generally, the test statistic may make further assumptions. The <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-test of the global null <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1 = \cdots \mu_K\)</span> assumes that the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th observation of group <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, say <span class="math inline">\(y_{ik}\)</span>, has average <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{E}(Y_{ik}) = \mu_k\)</span> and variance <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{Va}(Y_{ik}) = \sigma^2\)</span>. The latter is estimated using all of the residuals, with <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\sigma}^2 = \sum_k\sum_i (y_{ik} - \widehat{\mu}_k)^2/(n-K)\)</span>. Under these assumptions, the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-test statistic for the global null <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1 = \cdots = \mu_K\)</span> is the most powerful because it uses all of the data to get a more precise estimation of the variability. Generally, there may be other considerations than power that may guide the choice of test statistic, including robustness (sensitivity to extremes and outliers). For unequal variance, other statistics than the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-test statistic may be more powerful.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unlabeled-div-13" class="example"><strong>Example 3.3  (Additivity and transformations) </strong></span>Chapter 2 of <span class="citation">Cox (<a href="references.html#ref-Cox:1958" role="doc-biblioref">1958</a>)</span> discusses the assumption of additivity and provides useful examples showing when it cannot be taken for granted. One of them, Example 2.3, is a scenario in which the experimental units are participants and they are asked to provide a ranking of different kindergarden students on their capacity to interact with others in games, ranked on a scale of 0 to 100. A random group of students receives additional orthopedagogical support, while the balance is in the business-as-usual setting (control group). Since there are intrinsic differences at the student level, one could consider a <strong>paired experiment</strong> and take as outcome the difference in sociability scores at the beginning and at the end of the school year.</p>
<p>One can expect the treatment to have more impact on people with low sociability skills who were struggling to make contacts: a student who scored 50 initially might see an improvement of 20 points with support relative to 10 in the business-as-usual scenario, whereas another who is well integrated and scored high initially may see an improvement of only 5 more had (s)he been assigned to the support group. This implies that the treatment effects are not constant over the scale, a violation of the additivity assumption. One way to deal with this is via transformations: <span class="citation">Cox (<a href="references.html#ref-Cox:1958" role="doc-biblioref">1958</a>)</span> discusses the transformation <span class="math inline">\(\log\{(x+0.5)/(50-x)\}\)</span> to reduce the warping due to scale.</p>
</div>
<p>Another example is in experiments where the effect of treatment is multiplicative, so that the output is of the form
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\begin{pmatrix} \text{quantity depending only } \\
\text{on the particular unit}
\end{pmatrix} \times
\begin{pmatrix} \text{quantity depending} \\
\text{on the treatment used}\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}\]</span>
Usually, this arises for positive responses and treatments, in which case taking natural logarithms on both sides, with <span class="math inline">\(\log(xy) = \log x + \log y\)</span> yielding again an additive decomposition.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unlabeled-div-14" class="example"><strong>Example 3.4  (Inadequacy of additivity based on context) </strong></span>This example is adapted from <span class="citation">Cox (<a href="references.html#ref-Cox:1958" role="doc-biblioref">1958</a>)</span>, Example 2.2. Children suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may receive medication to increase their attention span, measured on a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 indicating normal attention span. An experiment can be designed to assess the impact of a standardized dose in a laboratory by comparing performances of students on a series of task before and after, when to a placebo. To make a case, suppose that students with ADHD fall into two categories: low symptoms and strong symptoms. In the low symptom group, the average attention is 8 per cent with the drug and 12 per cent with the placebo, whereas for people with strong symptoms, the average is 40 per cent among treated and 60 per cent with the placebo. If these two categories are equally represented in the experiment and the population, we would estimate an average reduction of 12 percent in the score (thus higher attention span among treated). Yet, this quantity is artificial, and a better measure would be that symptoms are for the treatment are 2/3 of those of the control (the ratio of proportions).</p>
</div>
<p>Equation <a href="CRT.html#eq:additive">(3.2)</a> also implies that the effect of the treatment is constant for all individuals. This often isnât the case: in an experimental study on the impact of teaching delivery type (online, hybrid, in person), it may be that the response to the choice of delivery mode depends on the different preferences of learning types (auditory, visual, kinestetic, etc.) Thus, recording additional measurements that are susceptible to interact may be useful; likewise, treatment allotment must factor in this variability should we wish to make it detectable. The solution to this would be to setup a more complex model (two-way analysis of variance, general linear model) or stratify by the explanatory variable (for example, compute the difference within each level).</p>

<p>The one-way ANOVA builds on the fact that the variance in each group is equal, so that upon recentering, we can estimate it from the variance of the residuals <span class="math inline">\(y_{ik} - \widehat{\mu}_k\)</span>.

<p>We can see in both cases that the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-values are large enough to dismiss any concern about the inequality of variance. However, should the latter be a problem, we can proceed with a test statistic that does not require variances to be equal. The most common choice is a modification due to Satterthwaite called Welchâs ANOVA. It is most commonly encountered in the case of two groups (<span class="math inline">\(K=2\)</span>) and is the default option in <strong>R</strong> with <code>t.test</code> or <code>oneway.test</code> (option <code>var.equal = TRUE</code>).</p>
<p>What happens with the example of the arithmetic data when we use this instead of the usual <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> statistic? Here, the evidence is overwhelming so no changes to the conclusion. Generally, the only drawback of using Welchâs ANOVA over the usual is the need to have enough observations in each of the group to reliably estimate a separate variance<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Coupled with a slight loss of power if the variance are truly equal, more later.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>21</sup></a>.

<p>Notice how the degrees of freedom of the denominator have decreased. If we use <code>pairwise.t.test</code> with argument <code>pool.sd=FALSE</code>, this amounts to running Welch <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-tests separately for each pair of variable.</p>
<p>What are the impacts of unequal variance if we use the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-test instead? For one, the pooled variance will be based on a weighted average of the variance in each group, where the weight is a function of the sample size. This can lead to size distortion (meaning that the proportion of type I error is not the nominal level <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> as claimed) and potential loss of power. The following toy example illustrates this.</p>

<p>We consider for simplicity a problem with <span class="math inline">\(K=2\)</span> groups, which is the two-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test. We simulated 50 observations from a <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{No}(0, 1)\)</span> distribution and 10 observations from <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{No}(0, 9)\)</span>, comparing the distribution of the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-values for the Welch and the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-test statistics. Figure <a href="CRT.html#fig:simuWelchnull">3.8</a> shows the results. The percentage of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-values less than <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0.05\)</span> based on 10 000 replicates is estimated to be 4.76% for the Welch statistic, not far from the level. By contrast, we reject 28.95% of the time with the one-way ANOVA global <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-test: this is a large share of innocents sentenced to jail based on false premises! While the size distortion is not always as striking, heterogeneity should be accounted in the design by requiring sufficient sample sizes (whenever costs permits) in each group to be able to estimate the variance reliably and using an adequate statistic.</p>

<p>There are alternative graphical ways of checking the assumption of equal variance, many including the standardized residuals <span class="math inline">\(r_{ik} = (y_{ik} - \widehat{\mu}_k)/\widehat{\sigma}\)</span> against the fitted values <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\mu}_k\)</span>.

<p>There is a persistent yet incorrect claim in the literature that the data (either response, explanatory or both) must be normal in order to use (so-called parameter) statistical tests like the one-way analysis of variable <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-test. With normal data and equal variances, the eponymous distributions of the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> tests are exact: knowing the exact distribution does not due harm and is convenient for mathematical derivations. However, this condition is **unnecessary: the results hold approximately for large samples because of the central limit theorem. This probability results dictates that, under general conditions nearly universally met, the sample mean behaves like a normal distribution in large samples. This <a href="http://195.134.76.37/applets/AppletCentralLimit/Appl_CentralLimit2.html">applet</a> lets you explore the impact of the underlying population from which the data are drawn and the interplay with the sample size before the central limit theorem kicks in. You can view this in Figure <a href="CRT.html#fig:Fdistpermut">3.2</a>, where the simulated and theoretical large-sample distributions are undistinguishable with approximately 20 observations per group.</p>
<p>While many authors may advocate rules of thumbs (sample size of <span class="math inline">\(n&gt;20\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(n&gt;30\)</span> per group, say), these rules are arbitrary: the approximation is not much worst at <span class="math inline">\(n=19\)</span> than at <span class="math inline">\(n=20\)</span>. How large must the sample size be for the approximation to hold? It largely depends on the distribution in the population: the more extremes, skewness, etc. you have, the larger the number of observation must be in order for the approximation to be valid. Figure <a href="CRT.html#fig:clt">3.9</a> shows a skewed to the right bimodal distribution and the distribution of the sample mean under repeated sampling. Even with <span class="math inline">\(n=5\)</span> observations (bottom left), the approximation is not bad but it may still be very far off with <span class="math inline">\(n=50\)</span> for heavy-tailed data.</p>

<p>It is important to keep in mind that all statistical statements are typically approximate and their reliability depends on the sample size: too small a sample may hampers the strength of your conclusions. The default graphic for checking whether a sample matches a postulated distribution is the quantile-quantile plot.</p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">3.4.4</span> Independence<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#independence"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>While I am not allowed to talk of independence as a Quebecer<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;All credits for this pun are due to C. Genest&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a>, this simply means that knowing the value of one observation tells us nothing about the value of any other in the sample. Independence may fail to hold in case of group structure (family dyads, cluster sampling) which have common characteristics or more simply in the case of repeated measurements. Random assignment to treatment is thus key to ensure that the measure holds, and ensuring at the measurement phase that there is no spillover.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unlabeled-div-16" class="example"><strong>Example 3.6  (Independence of measurements) </strong></span>There are many hidden ways in which measurements can impact the response. Physical devices that need to be calibrated before use (scales, microscope) require tuning: if measurements are done by different experimenters or on different days, it may impact and add systematic shift in means for the whole batch.</p>
</div>
<p>Special care must be taken whenever group testing is used, and blocking for potential impacts can salvage an analysis.</p>
<p>What is the impact of dependence between measurements? Heuristically, correlated measurements carry less information than independent ones. In the most extreme case, there is no additional information and measurements are identical. The reason why this makes a difference is the following: the denominator of the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-test is the sample variance, which is based on the within sum of squares divided by <span class="math inline">\(n-K\)</span>. If each observation is counted 10 times, say, then the real number of measurements is <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> but the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> statistic gets multiplied by a factor 10.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;The null distribution also changes with the sample size, but for &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt; large the impact is less than that of the scaling since the &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(F(d_1, d_2)\)&lt;/span&gt; distribution is approximately &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\chi^2(d_1)\)&lt;/span&gt; when &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(d_2\)&lt;/span&gt; is large.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>23</sup></a></p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The lack of independence can also have drastic consequences on inference and lead to false conclusions: Figure <a href="CRT.html#fig:plotLevelIndep">3.10</a> shows an example with correlated samples within group (or equivalently repeated measurements from individuals) with 25 observations per group. The <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis shows the size of the test, meaning the proportion of times the null is rejected. Here, since the data are generated from the null model (equal mean) with equal variance, the inflation in the number of spurious discoveries, false alarm or type I error is alarming and the inflation is substantial even with very limited correlation between measurements.</p>
