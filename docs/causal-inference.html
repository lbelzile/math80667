<p>A pet peeve of statisticians is to state that correlation (or association) between two phenomena is not the same as causation. For example, weather forecasts of rain and the number of people carrying umbrellas in the streets are positively correlated, but the relationship is directed: if I intervene as an experimenter and force everyone around to carry umbrellas, it won’t impact weather forecasts nor the weather itself. The website <a href="https://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations">Spurious correlations</a> by Tyler Vigen shows multiple graphs of absurd relations, many of which are simply artefact of population growth.</p>

<p>Causal inference is concerned with inferring the effect of an action or manipulation (intervention, policy, or treatment) applied to an observational unit and identifying and quantifying the effect of one variable on other variables. Such action may be conceptual: we can imagine for example looking at student’s success (as measured by their grades) by comparing two policies: giving them timely feedback and encouragement, versus no feedback. In reality, only one of these two scenarios can be realized even if both can conceptually be envisioned as <strong>potential outcomes</strong>.</p>
<p>The content of this chapter is divided as follows. First, we discuss the logical interrelation between variables using directed acyclic graphs and focus on relations between triples defining confounders, colliders and mediators. We then describe how we can retrieve causal effects (in an abstract setting). Finally, we present the linear mediation model popularized by <span class="citation">Baron and Kenny (<a href="references.html#ref-Baron.Kenny:1986" role="doc-biblioref">1986</a>)</span>. We focus on the hidden assumptions that can undermine causal claims of mediation.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">11.1</span> Basics of causal inference<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#basics-of-causal-inference"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>In an experiment, we can manipulate assignment to treatment <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and randomize units to each value of the treatment to avoid undue effects from other variables. The potential outcomes applies in between-subject design because experimental units are assigned to a single treatment, whereas in within-subject designs a single ordering is presented. If we denote the outcome by <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, then we are effectively comparing <span class="math inline">\((Y \mid X)\)</span> for different values of the action set <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> (for example, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> could be an experimental factor. We talk about causation when for treatment (<span class="math inline">\(X=j\)</span>) and control (<span class="math inline">\(X=0\)</span>), the distributions of <span class="math inline">\((Y \mid X=j)\)</span> differs from that of <span class="math inline">\((Y \mid X=0)\)</span>. The fundamental problem of causal inference is that, while we would like to study the impact of every action on our response, we can only observe the outcome for treatment <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, written <span class="math inline">\((Y_i \mid X=j)\)</span>.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;In a within-subject design, the analog is that a single ordering can be presented.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>Rather than look at the individual treatment effect, we must focus on the population effects. The most common measure of causation is the <strong>average treatment effect</strong>, which is the difference between the population averages of treatment group <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and the control group,
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\textsf{ATE}_j = \mathsf{E}(Y \mid X=j) - \mathsf{E}(Y \mid X=0)
\end{align*}\]</span>
In experimental designs, we can target the average treatment effect if our subjects comply with their treatment assignment and if we randomize the effect and use a random sample which is representative of the population.</p>
<p>In many fields, the unconditional effect is not interesting enough to warrant publication free of other explanatory variables. It may be that the effect of the treatment is not the same for everyone: for example, a study on gender discrimination may reveal different perceptions depending on gender, in which case the average treatment effect might not be a sensible measure and we could look at conditional effects. We may also be interested in seeing how different mechanisms and pathways are impacted by treatment and how this affects the response. <span class="citation">VanderWeele (<a href="references.html#ref-Vanderweele:2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> provides an excellent non-technical overview of mediation and interaction.</p>

<p>Causal inference requires a logical conceptual model of the interrelation between the variables. We will look at directed acyclic graphs to explain concepts of confounding, collision and mediation and how they can influence our conclusions.</p>
<p>To illustrate the relationship between variables, we use diagrams consisting of directed acyclic graph (DAG). A DAG is a graph with no cycle: each node represents a variable of interest and these are linked with directed edges indicating the nature of the relation (if <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> causes <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(X \to Y\)</span>). Directed acyclic graphs are used to represent the data generating process that causes interdependencies, while abstracting from the statistical description of the model. This depiction of the conceptual model helps to formalize and identify the assumptions of the model. To identify a causal effect of a variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on some response <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, we need to isolate the effect from that of other potential causes. Figure <a href="causal-inference.html#fig:fig-daggity">11.1</a> shows an example of DAG in a real study; the latter is a simplification or abstraction of a world view, but is already rather complicated.</p>

<p>At a theoretical level, the DAG will help identify which paths and relations to control through conditioning arguments to strip the relation to that of interest. Judea Pearl <span class="citation">(e.g., <a href="references.html#ref-Pearl:2016" role="doc-biblioref">Pearl, Glymour, and Jewell 2016</a>)</span> identifies three potential relations between triples of (sets of) variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>chains (<span class="math inline">\(X \to Z\to Y\)</span>),</li>
<li>forks (<span class="math inline">\(Z \leftarrow X \rightarrow Y\)</span>) and</li>
<li>reverse forks (<span class="math inline">\(Z \rightarrow X \leftarrow Y\)</span>).</li>
</ul>
<p>These are represented in Figure <a href="causal-inference.html#fig:fig-causalrelations">11.2</a>. In the graph, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> represents an explanatory variable, typically the experimental factor, <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is the response and <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> is another variable whose role depends on the logical flow between variables (collider, confounder or mediator).</p>

<p>In an experimental design, confounding effects from the experimental treatment <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to the response <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> are controlled by randomization or sample selection: all incoming arrows inside <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> from other variables are removed. If we include additional variables in the model which happen to be colliders, then we won’t recover the causal effect of interest. Addition of mediators will let us filter the effect due to <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> from the direct effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p>It is <em>essential</em> to determine via logic or otherwise (experiments can help!) the direction of the relationship, lest we run into trouble. Many statistical models commonly used, including regression models, cannot provide an answer to a problem that is philosophical or conceptual in nature. Indeed, correlation is symmetric and insufficient to infer the direction of the arrows in the directed acyclic graph.</p>
<p>The conclusions we will draw from statistical models depend on the nature of the relation. For example, in an observational setting, we could eliminate the effect of a confounding variable by controlling in a regression model or by stratifying for different values of the confounders in order to extract the causal estimate of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. However, the same strategy with a collider would backfire and we would get erroneous conclusions: <span class="citation">Kowal (<a href="references.html#ref-Kowal:2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> reportedly found out married couples with more children were less happy. As Richard McElreath hinted, controlling for marriage (through sample selection) is incorrect since unhappy couples tend to divorce, but families with many children are less likely to divorce!</p>
<p>In a randomized experiment, we can check the average outcome of a manipulation by comparing groups: assuming random sampling, these conclusions can be broadly generalized to the population of interest from which the sample is drawn. However, it may be that the effect of the treatment depends on other variables: cultural differences, gender or education may change. In the statistical model, inclusion of interaction terms (typically product of the moderator variable with the factor encoding the experimental sub-condition) will allow us to estimate those differences.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">11.2</span> Mediation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#mediation"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>In order to do inference and tests relations, we need to add to our logical causal model represented by a directed acyclic graph a data generating mechanisms that prescribes how variables how interrelated. Our ability to establish mediation will depend on the model and a set of assumptions, some of which won’t be verifiable.</p>
<p>To define in full generality the treatment and mediation effect, we need to consider the potential outcome framework. Following <span class="citation">Pearl (<a href="references.html#ref-Pearl:2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>, we use <span class="math inline">\(Y_i(x, m)\)</span> to denote the potential outcome for individual <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> with explanatory or experimental covariate/factor <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and mediator <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. Likewise, <span class="math inline">\(M_i(x)\)</span> is the potential mediator when applying treatment level <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<p>The <strong>total effect</strong> measures the overall impact of changes in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> (both through <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and directly) when experimentally manipulating <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>,
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}\mathsf{TE}(x, x^*) = \mathsf{E}[ Y \mid \text{do}(X=x)] - \mathsf{E}[ Y \mid \text{do}(X=x^*)],
\end{align*}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(x^*\)</span> is the factor level of the reference or control and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is another treatment value. This definition generalizes when <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a continuous variable.</p>
<p>The average controlled directed effect measures the flow along <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y\)</span>, disabling the pathway <span class="math inline">\(X \to M \to Y\)</span>; it is
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\textsf{CDE}(m, x, x^{*}) &amp;= \mathsf{E}[Y \mid \text{do}(X=x, m=m)] - \mathsf{E}[Y \mid \text{do}(X=x^{*}, m=m) \\&amp;= \mathsf{E}(Y_{x, m} -Y_{x^*, m})]
\end{align*}\]</span>
This measures the expected change in response when the experimental factor changes from <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(x^*\)</span> and the mediator is set to a fixed value <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> uniformly over the population.</p>
<p>The <strong>natural direct effect</strong>,
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\textsf{NDE}(x, x^*) = \mathsf{E}(Y_{x, M_{x^*}} - Y_{x^*,  M_{x^*}}),
\end{align*}\]</span>
is the expected change in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> under treatment <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is set to whatever value it would take under control <span class="math inline">\(x^*\)</span>.</p>
<p>The <strong>natural indirect effect</strong> (<span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{NIE}\)</span>) is the expected change in the response <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> if we set our experimental value <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to its control value <span class="math inline">\(x^*\)</span> and change the mediator value which it would attain under <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>,
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\textsf{NIE}(x, x^*) = \mathsf{E}\{Y(x^*, M_{x}) - Y(x^*,  M({x^*)})
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>Armed with these definitions, we can consider the <strong>sequential ignorability assumption</strong>, which is decomposed into two components.</p>
<p>Given pre-treatment covariates <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>, potential outcomes for mediation and outcome are conditionally independent of treatment assignment.
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
Y_i(x', m), M_i(x) \perp\mkern-10mu\perp X_i \mid W_i = w.
\end{align*}\]</span>
In order words, the values taken by the mediator and by the response exist independently of the treatment assignment and don’t change. The dependence on <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is used for situations where we can perform randomization based on pre-treatment assignment (i.e., we specify a mechanisms that is not equal based, but the probability of assignment is known from each individual). The first condition is satisfied in experimental studies due to randomization.</p>
<p>The second component Given pre-treatment covariates and observed treatment, potential outcomes are independent of mediation.
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
Y_i(x', m) \perp\mkern-10mu\perp  M_i(x) \mid X_i =x, W_i = w
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>The set of assumptions from <span class="citation">Imai, Keele, and Tingley (<a href="references.html#ref-Imai:2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">Pearl (<a href="references.html#ref-Pearl:2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> are equivalent under randomization of treatment assignment as we consider thereafter.</p>
<p>When measuring effects in psychology and marketing, it will often be the case that the conceptual causal model includes variables that cannot be directly measured. The proxy, as in Figure <a href="causal-inference.html#fig:xkcd2652">11.3</a> add an additional layer of complexity and potential sources of confounding.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">11.3</span> Linear mediation model<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#linear-mediation-model"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>One of the most popular model in social sciences is the linear mediation model, popularized by <span class="citation">Baron and Kenny (<a href="references.html#ref-Baron.Kenny:1986" role="doc-biblioref">1986</a>)</span> although the method predates this publication. Another inferential approach, suggested by <span class="citation">Preacher and Hayes (<a href="references.html#ref-Preacher.Hayes:2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span>, uses the same model with different test statistics and is extremely popular because it comes with software; Hayes’ (infamous) <a href="https://www.processmacro.org/index.html">PROCESS macros for SAS, SPSS and <strong>R</strong></a> have lead to the widespread adoption by researchers. <span class="citation">Bullock, Green, and Ha (<a href="references.html#ref-Bullock.Green.Ha:2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span> list limitations of the approach and provide examples of instances in which the model does not have a meaningful causal interpretation.</p>
<p>The linear mediation model assumes that the effect of mediation and treatment is additive and that the response measurement is continuous. Consider covariates <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Z}\)</span>, experimental factor <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{X}\)</span> corresponding to treatment and postulated mediator variable <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, assumed continuous. Given <strong>uncorrelated</strong> unobserved noise variables <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_Y\)</span>, we specify linear regression models,
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
M \mid X=x &amp;= c_M + \alpha x + \varepsilon_M,\\

\end{align}\]</span>
where we use the contrast-to-reference parametrization so that the reference category for the intercept corresponds to control (group <span class="math inline">\(x^*\)</span>) and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> the other category of interest, with <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> capturing the difference between <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x^*\)</span>. The model for <span class="math inline">\(Y \mid X, M\)</span> should including additional covariates <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{z}\)</span> to control for confounding between <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</p>
<p>The parameters can be interpreted as the direct (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>), indirect (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha \gamma\)</span>) and total (<span class="math inline">\(\beta + \alpha \gamma\)</span>) effects. To see this, we plug the first equation in the second and obtain the marginal model for <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> given treatment <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>,
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
Y \mid X=x &amp;= \underset{\text{intercept}}{(c_Y + \gamma c_M)} + \underset{\text{total effect}}{(\beta + \alpha\gamma)}\cdot x + \underset{\text{error}}{(\gamma U_M + U_Y)}\\
&amp;= c_Y' + \tau X + U_Y'
\end{align}\]</span>
These parameters can be estimated using structural equation models (SEM), or more typically by running a series of linear regression (ordinary least squares).</p>
<p>In the linear mediation model, we can estimate the conditional direct effect corresponding to the product of coefficients <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\gamma\)</span>. Absence of mediation implies the product is zero. <span class="citation">Baron and Kenny (<a href="references.html#ref-Baron.Kenny:1986" role="doc-biblioref">1986</a>)</span> recommended using Sobel’s test statistic, a Wald-test of the form
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
S  = \frac{\widehat{\alpha}\widehat{\gamma} - 0}{\mathsf{se}(\widehat{\alpha}\widehat{\gamma})} =  \frac{\widehat{\alpha}\widehat{\gamma}}{\sqrt{\widehat{\gamma}^2\mathsf{Va}(\widehat{\alpha}) + \widehat{\alpha}^2\mathsf{Va}(\widehat{\gamma}) + \mathsf{Va}(\widehat{\gamma})\mathsf{Va}(\widehat{\alpha})}} \stackrel{\cdot}{\sim}\mathsf{No}(0,1)
\end{align*}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\alpha}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\gamma}\)</span> and their variance <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{Va}(\widehat{\alpha})\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{Va}(\widehat{\gamma})\)</span> can be obtained from the estimated coefficients and standard errors.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;Sobel derived the asymptotic variance using a first-order Taylor series expansion assuming both &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\alpha\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\gamma\)&lt;/span&gt; are non-zero (hence the tests!)&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>49</sup></a> The Sobel’s statistic <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is approximately standard normal in large samples, but the approximation is sometimes crude.</p>
<p>In the linear mediation causal model, we can estimate the total causal effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, labelled <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>, by running the linear regression of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> as there is no confounding affecting treatment <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> in a completely randomized experimental design. This strategy isn’t valid with observational data unless we adjust for confounders. Under no unmeasured confounders and linearity, the product <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\gamma\)</span> is also equal to the difference between the total effect and the <strong>natural direct effect</strong>, <span class="math inline">\(\tau - \beta\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Baron and Kenny (<a href="references.html#ref-Baron.Kenny:1986" role="doc-biblioref">1986</a>)</span> suggested for <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> continuous breaking down the task in three separate steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>fit a linear regression of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to estimate <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>
</li>
<li>fit a linear regression of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to estimate <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>
</li>
<li>fit a linear regression of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> to estimate <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>They then go to check that <span class="math inline">\(\alpha, \delta, \gamma\)</span> are non-zero by testing the null hypotheses <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0: \alpha=0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0: \delta=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0: \gamma=0\)</span> against the two-sided alternatives.</p>
<p>This approach has caveats since mediation refers to the relation $X M <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, so we only need to consider (joint tests of) <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>. <span class="citation">Zhao, Lynch, and Chen (<a href="references.html#ref-Zhao.Lynch.Chen:2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span> review the typology of mediation.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>complementary mediation when both direct and indirect effects are of the same sign and non-zero.</li>
<li>competitive mediation when direct and indirect effects are of opposite signs.</li>
<li>indirect-only mediation when the direct effect of <span class="math inline">\(X \to Y\)</span> is null, but the effect <span class="math inline">\(X \to M \to Y\)</span> isn’t.</li>
</ol>
<p>To see this, let’s generate data with a binary treatment and normally distributed mediators and response with no confounding (so the data generating process matches exactly the formulation fo Baron–Kenny. We set <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta = 1/2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma=0\)</span>. This is an instance where the null is true (<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> affects both <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>).</p>

</div>
<p>If we knew exactly the model that generated <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and the relations between them, we could simulate multiple datasets like in Figure <a href="causal-inference.html#fig:fig-sobelsimu">11.4</a> with <span class="math inline">\(n=20\)</span> observations and compare the test statistic we obtained with the simulation-based null distribution with <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\gamma=0\)</span>. In practice we do not know the model that generated the data and furthermore we have a single dataset at hand. An alternative is the bootstrap, a form of simulation-based inference. The latter is conceptually easy to understand: we generate new datasets by resampling from the ones observed (as if it was the population). Since we want the sample size to be identical and our objective is to get heterogeneity, we sample with replacement: from one bootstrap dataset to the next, we will have multiple copies, or none, of each observation. See <span class="citation">Efron and Tibshirani (<a href="references.html#ref-Efron.Tibshirani:1993" role="doc-biblioref">1993</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">Davison and Hinkley (<a href="references.html#ref-Davison.Hinkley:1997" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a>)</span> for a more thorough treatment of the bootstrap and alternative sampling schemes for regression models. The nonparametric bootstrap procedure advocated by <span class="citation">Preacher and Hayes (<a href="references.html#ref-Preacher.Hayes:2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span> consists in repeating the following <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> times:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>sample <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> observations <strong>with replacement</strong>, i.e., a tuple (<span class="math inline">\(X_i, M_i, Y_i)\)</span>, from the original data .</li>
<li>compute the natural indirect effect <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\alpha}\cdot\widehat{\gamma}\)</span> on each simulated sample</li>
</ol>
<p>For a two-sided test at level <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, compute the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha/2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1-\alpha/2\)</span> quantiles of the bootstrap statistics <span class="math inline">\(\{\widehat{\alpha}_b\widehat{\gamma}_b\}_{b=1}^B\)</span>. For example, if the level is <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=5\)</span>% and we generate <span class="math inline">\(B=1000\)</span> bootstrap samples, the percentile confidence intervals bounds are the 25th and 975th ordered observations.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the asymptotic approximation (sometimes misnamed delta method<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;The latter is the name of the method used to derive the denominator of Sobel’s statistic.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>50</sup></a>) has fallen out of fashion among practitioners, who prefer the nonparametric bootstrap coupled with the percentile method.</p>

<p>The nonparametric percentile bootstrap confidence interval for <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\gamma\)</span> is [-0.08, 1.71] and thus we fail to reject the null hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{H}_0: \alpha \gamma=0\)</span>.</p>
