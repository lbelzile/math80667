Thinking outside the box: 

- potential confounders?
- reweighting using demographic information

The null hypothesis of the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) problem is $\mathscr{H}_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3$, where $\mu_i$ $(i=1, \ldots, 3)$ is the expectation of group $i$.

Homogeneity

Null hypothesis and comparing means of multiple groups
Assumptions
Plot your data
Data compression: what you need to report?
EXPERT TIPS: visualisation tools, histograms and line charts for ordered factors.

Reminder: must be handling the confounding via randomization or blocking (explicitly)

Where do we get our power from? Decomposition of the sum of squares TOTAL = BETWEEN + WITHIN

What happens under the null
What happens under the alternative: some illustrations with simulated data

Potential ways of assessing the null hypothesis
- what assumptions are we making in the process? where do we draw our power from
Alternative test statistics: Welch and permutation (and their validity)
Power considerations: choosing the sample size
- estimate of effect size, type I error, number of levels (subsample size), variability

Careful with observed power (using the observed effect size in the calculation)
Practical significance versus statistical significance


Thinking outside the box: how to allocate sample sizes when we do not have equal variance

What about unbalanced experiments?
What can go WRONG?
- The experiment is not properly conducted 2.4.6 in Lawson (2014)
- lurking variables: effective teaching methods, confounded with instructor/class time/voluntary participation
-> independence of errors to unit
-> measurements are not normal (or continuous)
- need experimental units and large enough sample sizes
- Example with variance increasing together with the level of the response

## Contrasts and pairwise tests

Reparametrizing the model
Statistical fallacy: data dredging
Multiple comparisons and family-wise error rates
  Preplanned experiments: why penalie large studies
  How much data do you need to reliably estimate
Methods for controlling multiplicity

Thinking outside the box: no free lunch.
