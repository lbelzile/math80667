# Causal inference


A pet peeve of statisticians is to state that correlation (or association) between two phenomena is not the same as causation. For example, weather forecasts of rain and the number of people carrying umbrellas in the streets are positively correlated, but the relationship is directed: if I intervene as an experimenter and force everyone around to carry umbrellas, it won't impact weather forecasts nor the weather itself.
The website [Spurious correlations](https://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations) by Tyler Vigen shows multiple graphs of absurd relations, many of which are simply artefact of population growth.

Causal inference is concerned with inferring the effect of an action or manipulation (intervention, policy, or treatment) applied to an observational unit and identifying and quantifying the effect of one variable on other variables.  Such action may be conceptual: we can imagine for example looking at student's success (as measured by their grades) by comparing two policies: giving them timely feedback and encouragement, versus no feedback. In reality, only one of these two scenarios can be realized even if both can conceptually be envisioned as **potential outcomes**. The fundamental problem of causal inference is that while we would like to study the impact of every action on our response, we can only effectively measure it in one scenario^[In a within-subject design, a single ordering can be presented.]



In an experiment, we can manipulate assignment to treatment $a$ and randomize units to each value of the treatment to avoid undue effects from other variables. The potential outcomes applies in between-subject design because experimental units are assigned to a single treatment, whereas in within-subject designs a single ordering is presented. If we denote the outcome by $Y$, then we are effectively comparing $(Y \mid X)$ for different values of the action set $X$ (for example, $X$ could be an experimental factor. We talk about causation when for treatment ($X=j$) and control ($X=0$), the distributions of $(Y \mid X=j)$ differs from that of $(Y \mid X=0)$.

The fundamental problem of causal inference is that we typically cannot compare the outcome for all different treatments for the same individuals, i.e., we can only observe the outcome for one treatment $X=j$, $(Y_i \mid X=j)$.

Rather than look at the individual treatment effect, we must focus on the population effects. The most common measure of causation is the **average treatment effect**, which is the difference between the population averages of treatment group $j$ and the control group,
\begin{align*}
\textsf{ATE}_j = \mathsf{E}(Y \mid X=j) - \mathsf{E}(Y \mid X=0)
\end{align*}
In experimental designs, we can target the average treatment effect if our subjects comply with their treatment assignment and if we randomize the effect and use a random sample which is representative of the population.

In many fields, the unconditional effect is not interesting enough to warrant publication free of other explanatory variables. It may be that the effect of the treatment is not the same for everyone: for example, a study on gender discrimination may reveal different perceptions depending on the gender. We could look at conditional effects and potential interactions. We may also be interested in seeing how different mechanisms and pathways are impacted by treatment and how this affects the response. @Vanderweele:2015 provides an excellent non-technical overview of mediation and interaction.

Many statistical models commonly used, including regression models, cannot provide an answer to a problem that is philosophical or conceptual in nature.

Causal inference requires a logical conceptual model of the interrelation between the variables. We will look at directed acyclic graphs to explain concepts of confounding, collision and mediation and how they can influence.

A directed acyclic graph (DAG) a graph with no cycle: each node represents a variable of interest and these are linked with directed edges indicating the nature of the relation (if $X$ causes $Y$, then $X \to Y$). Directed acyclic graphs are used to represent the data generating process that causes interdependencies, while abstracting from the statistical description of the model. This depiction of the conceptual model helps to formalize and identify the assumptions of the model. To identify a causal effect of a variable $X$ on some response $Y$, we need to isolate the effect from that of other potential causes.
Figure \@ref(fig:fig-daggity) shows an example of DAG in a real world study identifying pathways.

At a theoretical level, the DAG will help identify which paths and relations to control through conditioning arguments to strip the relation to that of interest. Judea Pearl [e.g., @Pearl:2016] identifies three potential relations between triples of (sets of) variables: 

- chains ($X \to Z\to Y$), 
- forks ($Z \leftarrow X \rightarrow Y$) and 
- reverse forks ($Z \rightarrow X \leftarrow Y$).

These are represented in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-causalrelations). In the graph, $X$ represents an explanatory variable, typically the experimental factor, $Y$ is the response and $Z$ is another variable whose role depends on the logical flow between variables (collider, confounder or mediator).

In an experimental design, confounding effects from the experimental treatment $X$ to the response $Y$ are controlled by randomization or sample selection: all incoming arrows inside $X$ from other variables are removed. If we include additional variables in the model which happen to be colliders, then we won't recover the causal effect of interest. Addition of mediators will let us filter the effect due to $Z$ from the direct effect of $X$.

It is *essential* to determine via logic or otherwise (experiments can help!) the direction of the relationship, lest we run into trouble. Popular statistical tools such as linear regression capture correlation, which is symmetric and so cannot help the direction of the arrows in the directed acyclic graph. 

The conclusions we will draw from statistical models depend on the nature of the relation. For example, in an observational setting, we could eliminate the effect of a confounding variable by controlling in a regression model or by stratifying for different values of the confounders in order to extract the causal estimate of $X$ on $Y$. However, the same strategy with a collider would backfire and we would get erroneous conclusions: @Kowal:2021 reportedly found out married couples with more children were less happy. As Richard McElreath hinted, controlling for marriage (through sample selection) is incorrect since unhappy couples tend to divorce, but families with many children are less likely to divorce! This invalides the reasoning of the paper.




The content of this chapter is divided as follows. First, we discuss the logical interrelation between variables using directed acyclic graphs and focus on relations between triples defining confounders, colliders and mediators. We then describe how we can retrieve causal effects (in an abstract setting). Finally, we present the linear mediation model popularized by @Baron.Kenny:1986. We focus on the hidden assumptions that can undermine causal claims of mediation.


In a randomized experiment, we can check the average outcome of a manipulation by comparing groups: assuming random sampling, these conclusions can be broadly generalized to the population of interest from which the sample is drawn. However, it may be that the effect of the treatment depends on other variables: cultural differences, gender or education may change. In the statistical model, inclusion of interaction terms (typically product of the moderator variable with the factor encoding the experimental sub-condition) will allow us to estimate those differences. 

## Mediation

In order to do inference and tests relations, we need to add to our logical causal model represented by a directed acyclic graph a data generating mechanisms that prescribes how variables how interrelated. Our ability to establish mediation will depend on the model and a set of assumptions, some of which won't be verifiable.

Following @Pearl:2016, we use $Y_i(x, m)$ to denote the outcome for individual $i$ with explanatory or experimental covariate/factor $x$ and mediator $m$. 

We can consider the sequential ignorability assumption:

Given pre-treatment covariates $W$, potential outcomes for mediation and treatment are conditionally independent of treatment assignment.
$$Y_i(x', m), M_i(x) \perp\mkern-10mu\perp X_i \mid W_i = w$$
Given pre-treatment covariates and observed treatment, potential outcomes are independent of mediation.
$$ Y_i(x', m) \perp\mkern-10mu\perp  M_i(x) \mid X_i =x, W_i = w$$

The first condition is satisfied in experimental studies due to randomization.




When measuring effects in psychology and marketing, it will often be the case that the conceptual causal model includes variables that cannot be directly measured. The proxy, as in Figure \@ref(fig:xkcd2652) add an additional layer of complexity and potential sources of confounding.

## Linear mediation model


One of the most popular model in social sciences is the linear mediation model, popularized by @Baron.Kenny:2016. We will present in details the basis for inference and highlight the assumptions of the model required for the results to have a causal interpretation and robustness of the results to model misspecification.



# Total effect

**Total effect**: overall impact of $X$ (both through $M$ and directly)

\begin{align*}\mathsf{TE}(x, x^*) = \mathsf{E}[ Y \mid \text{do}(X=x)] - \mathsf{E}[ Y \mid \text{do}(X=x^*)]\end{align*}

This can be generalized for continuous $X$ to any pair of values $(x_1, x_2)$.


The average controlled direct effect is
\begin{align*}\textsf{CDE}(m, x, x^*) &= \mathsf{E}[Y \mid \text{do}(X=x, m=m)] - \mathsf{E}[Y \mid \text{do}(X=x^*, m=m) \\&= \mathsf{E}(Y_{x, m} -Y_{x^*, m})
\end{align*}
Expected population change in response when the experimental factor changes from $x$ to $x^*$ and the mediator is set to a fixed value $m$.



The **natural direct effect**, $$\textsf{NDE}(x, x^*) = \mathsf{E}(Y_{x, M_{x^*}} - Y_{x^*,  M_{x^*}}),$$
is the expected change in $Y$ under treatment $x$ if $M$ is set to whatever value it would take under control $x^*$.


The **natural indirect effect** ($\mathsf{NIE}$) is the expected change in the response $Y$ if we set our experimental value $X$ to its control value and change the mediator value which it would attain under $x$,
$$\textsf{NIE}(x, x^*) = \mathsf{E}\{Y(x^*, M_{x}) - Y(x^*,  M({x^*)})$$



One such assumption is **sequential ignorability**
Given pre-treatment covariates , potential outcomes for mediation and
treatment are conditionally independent of treatment assignment.
