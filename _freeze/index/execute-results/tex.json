We will pay particular attention to the correct reporting and interpretation of results and learn how to review critically scientific papers using experimental designs.\nThe unifying theme of the book is that statistics are summary of evidence, and statistic as a field is the science of decision-making in the presence of uncertainty. We use examples drawn from published articles in management sciences to illustrate core concepts.\n",
