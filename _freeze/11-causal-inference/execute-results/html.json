Such action may be conceptual: we can imagine for example looking at student's success (as measured by their grades) by comparing two policies: giving them timely feedback and encouragement, versus no feedback. In reality, only one of these two scenarios can be realized even if both can conceptually be envisioned as **potential outcomes**. \n\n\nThe content of this chapter is divided as follows. First, we discuss the logical interrelation between variables using directed acyclic graphs and focus on relations between triples defining confounders, colliders and mediators. We then describe how we can retrieve causal effects (in an abstract setting). Finally, we present the linear mediation model popularized by @Baron.Kenny:1986. We focus on the hidden assumptions that can undermine causal claims of mediation.\n\n## Basics of causal inference\n\nIn an experiment, we can manipulate assignment to treatment $a$ and randomize units to each value of the treatment to avoid undue effects from other variables. The potential outcomes applies in between-subject design because experimental units are assigned to a single treatment, whereas in within-subject designs a single ordering is presented. If we denote the outcome by $Y$, then we are effectively comparing $(Y \\mid X)$ for different values of the action set $X$ (for example, $X$ could be an experimental factor. We talk about causation when for treatment ($X=j$) and control ($X=0$), the distributions of $(Y \\mid X=j)$ differs from that of $(Y \\mid X=0)$. The fundamental problem of causal inference is that, while we would like to study the impact of every action on our response, we can only observe the outcome for treatment $j$, written $(Y_i \\mid X=j)$.^[In a within-subject design, the analog is that a single ordering can be presented.] \n\nRather than look at the individual treatment effect, we must focus on the population effects. The most common measure of causation is the **average treatment effect**, which is the difference between the population averages of treatment group $j$ and the control group,\n\\begin{align*}\n\\textsf{ATE}_j = \\mathsf{E}(Y \\mid X=j) - \\mathsf{E}(Y \\mid X=0)\n\\end{align*}\nIn experimental designs, we can target the average treatment effect if our subjects comply with their treatment assignment and if we randomize the effect and use a random sample which is representative of the population.\n\nIn many fields, the unconditional effect is not interesting enough to warrant publication free of other explanatory variables. It may be that the effect of the treatment is not the same for everyone: for example, a study on gender discrimination may reveal different perceptions depending on gender, in which case the average treatment effect might not be a sensible measure and we could look at conditional effects. We may also be interested in seeing how different mechanisms and pathways are impacted by treatment and how this affects the response. @Vanderweele:2015 provides an excellent non-technical overview of mediation and interaction.\n\n\n\n<!--\nTODO: write about conditional average treatment effect (CATE) and local average treatment effect. Discuss noncompliance and potential selection effects (selection on colliders)\n-->\n Causal inference requires a logical conceptual model of the interrelation between the variables. We will look at directed acyclic graphs to explain concepts of confounding, collision and mediation and how they can influence our conclusions.\n\nTo illustrate the relationship between variables, we use diagrams consisting of directed acyclic graph (DAG). A DAG is a graph with no cycle: each node represents a variable of interest and these are linked with directed edges indicating the nature of the relation (if $X$ causes $Y$, then $X \\to Y$). Directed acyclic graphs are used to represent the data generating process that causes interdependencies, while abstracting from the statistical description of the model. This depiction of the conceptual model helps to formalize and identify the assumptions of the model. To identify a causal effect of a variable $X$ on some response $Y$, we need to isolate the effect from that of other potential causes. @fig-daggity shows an example of DAG in a real study; the latter is a simplification or abstraction of a world view, but is already rather complicated.\n\n<!--https://bookdown.org/mike/data_analysis/causal-inference.html-->\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='11-causal-inference_cache/html/fig-daggity_199e17b7e15faaae9fc9fd3c9d1fd328'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Directed acyclic graph of @McQuire:2020 reproduction by [Andrew Heiss](https://www.andrewheiss.com/), licensed under [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/).](figures/dagitty-model.png){#fig-daggity fig-align='center' width=60%}\n:::\n:::\n\nAt a theoretical level, the DAG will help identify which paths and relations to control through conditioning arguments to strip the relation to that of interest. Judea Pearl [e.g., @Pearl:2016] identifies three potential relations between triples of (sets of) variables: \n\n- chains ($X \\to Z\\to Y$), \n- forks ($Z \\leftarrow X \\rightarrow Y$) and \n- reverse forks ($Z \\rightarrow X \\leftarrow Y$).\n\nThese are represented in @fig-causalrelations. In the graph, $X$ represents an explanatory variable, typically the experimental factor, $Y$ is the response and $Z$ is another variable whose role depends on the logical flow between variables (collider, confounder or mediator).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='11-causal-inference_cache/html/fig-causalrelations_2ba20dfeea62be27003c971007f12bc0'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Type of causal relations by Andrew Heiss, licensed under [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/).](figures/causal_dag_aheiss.jpg){#fig-causalrelations fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn an experimental design, confounding effects from the experimental treatment $X$ to the response $Y$ are controlled by randomization or sample selection: all incoming arrows inside $X$ from other variables are removed. If we include additional variables in the model which happen to be colliders, then we won't recover the causal effect of interest. Addition of mediators will let us filter the effect due to $Z$ from the direct effect of $X$.\n\nIt is *essential* to determine via logic or otherwise (experiments can help!) the direction of the relationship, lest we run into trouble. Many statistical models commonly used, including regression models, cannot provide an answer to a problem that is philosophical or conceptual in nature. Indeed, correlation is symmetric and insufficient to infer the direction of the arrows in the directed acyclic graph. \n\n\nThe conclusions we will draw from statistical models depend on the nature of the relation. For example, in an observational setting, we could eliminate the effect of a confounding variable by controlling in a regression model or by stratifying for different values of the confounders in order to extract the causal estimate of $X$ on $Y$. However, the same strategy with a collider would backfire and we would get erroneous conclusions: @Kowal:2021 reportedly found out married couples with more children were less happy. As Richard McElreath hinted, controlling for marriage (through sample selection) is incorrect since unhappy couples tend to divorce, but families with many children are less likely to divorce! \n\n\n\nIn a randomized experiment, we can check the average outcome of a manipulation by comparing groups: assuming random sampling, these conclusions can be broadly generalized to the population of interest from which the sample is drawn. However, it may be that the effect of the treatment depends on other variables: cultural differences, gender or education may change. In the statistical model, inclusion of interaction terms (typically product of the moderator variable with the factor encoding the experimental sub-condition) will allow us to estimate those differences. \n\n## Mediation\n\nIn order to do inference and tests relations, we need to add to our logical causal model represented by a directed acyclic graph a data generating mechanisms that prescribes how variables how interrelated. Our ability to establish mediation will depend on the model and a set of assumptions, some of which won't be verifiable. \n\n\n\nTo define in full generality the treatment and mediation effect, we need to consider the potential outcome framework. Following @Pearl:2014, we use $Y_i(x, m)$ to denote the potential outcome for individual $i$ with explanatory or experimental covariate/factor $x$ and mediator $m$. Likewise, $M_i(x)$ is the potential mediator when applying treatment level $x$.^[The notation is important to distinguish between association $Y \\mid X$ when observing $X$ from manipulations or interventions, $Y \\mid \\mathsf{do}(X)$ and counterfactuals $Y(X)$.]\n\n\nThe **total effect** measures the  overall impact of changes in outcome $Y$ (both through $M$ and directly) when experimentally manipulating $X$,\n\\begin{align*}\\mathsf{TE}(x, x^*) = \\mathsf{E}[ Y \\mid \\text{do}(X=x)] - \\mathsf{E}[ Y \\mid \\text{do}(X=x^*)],\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $x^*$ is the factor level of the reference or control and $x$ is another treatment value. This definition generalizes when $X$ is a continuous variable.\n\nThe **average controlled directed effect** measures the flow along $X \\rightarrow Y$, disabling the pathway $X \\to M \\to Y$ by fixing the mediatior: it is\n\\begin{align*}\n\\textsf{CDE}(m, x, x^*) &= \n\\mathsf{E}[Y \\mid \\text{do}(X=x, m=m)] - \\mathsf{E}[Y \\mid \\text{do}(X=x^*, m=m)] \\\\&= \\mathsf{E}\\{Y(x,m) -Y(x^*, m)\\}\n\\end{align*}\nThis measures the expected change in response when the experimental factor changes from $x$ to $x^*$ and the mediator is set to a fixed value $m$ uniformly over the population. \n\nThe **natural direct effect**, \n\\begin{align*}\n\\textsf{NDE}(x, x^*) = \\mathsf{E}[Y\\{x, M(x^*)\\} - Y\\{x^*,  M(x^*)\\}],\n\\end{align*}\nis the expected change in $Y$ under treatment $x$ if $M$ is set to whatever value it would take under control $x^*$.\n\nThe **natural indirect effect** ($\\mathsf{NIE}$) is the expected change in the response $Y$ if we set our experimental value $X$ to its control value $x^*$ and change the mediator value which it would attain under $x$,\n\\begin{align*}\n\\textsf{NIE}(x, x^*) = \\mathsf{E}[Y\\{x^*, M(x)\\} - Y\\{x^*,  M(x^*)\\}]\n\\end{align*}\n\n\n\nArmed with these definitions, we can consider the **sequential ignorability assumption**, which is decomposed into two components.\n\nThe first component is: given pre-treatment covariates $W$, treatment assignment is independent of potential outcomes for mediation and outcome,\n\\begin{align*}\nY_i(x', m), M_i(x) \\perp\\mkern-10mu\\perp X_i \\mid W_i = w.\n\\end{align*}\nIn order words, the values taken by the mediator and by the response exist independently of the treatment assignment and don't change.^[The dependence on $W$ is used for situations where we can perform randomization based on pre-treatment assignment (i.e., we specify a mechanisms that is not equal based, but the probability of assignment is known from each individual).]\n\nThe second component of the sequential ignorability assumption is as follows: given pre-treatment covariates and observed treatment, mediation is independent of potential outcomes,\n\\begin{align*}\nY_i(x', m) \\perp\\mkern-10mu\\perp  M_i(x) \\mid X_i =x, W_i = w\n\\end{align*}\nThe set of assumptions from @Imai:2010 and @Pearl:2014 are equivalent under randomization of treatment assignment, as we consider thereafter.\n\nThe total effect can be written \n$$\\mathsf{TE}(x, x^*) = \\mathsf{NDE}(x, x^*) - \\mathsf{NIE}(x^*, x).$$\nIn the linear mediation model, the reversal of argument amounts to changing the sign of the coefficient, giving an additive decomposition of the total effect as $\\mathsf{TE} = \\mathsf{NDE} + \\mathsf{NIE}$ [@Pearl:2014]. \n\nWhen measuring effects in psychology and marketing, it will often be the case that the conceptual causal model includes variables that cannot be directly measured. The proxy, as in @fig-xkcd2652, add an additional layer of complexity and potential sources of confounding.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='11-causal-inference_cache/html/fig-xkcd2652_18799cb0cb479e388b7a00d2566697ef'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![xkcd comic [2652 (Proxy Variable) by Randall Munroe](https://xkcd.com/2652/).

Another inferential approach, suggested by @Preacher.Hayes:2004, uses the same model with different test statistics and is extremely popular because it comes with software; Hayes' [PROCESS macros for SAS, SPSS and **R**](https://www.processmacro.org/index.html) have lead to the widespread adoption by researchers. @Bullock.Green.Ha:2010 list limitations of the approach and provide examples of instances in which the model does not have a meaningful causal interpretation.\n\nThe linear mediation model assumes that the effect of mediation and treatment is additive and that the response measurement is continuous. Consider covariates $\\mathbf{Z}$, experimental factor $\\mathbf{X}$ corresponding to treatment and postulated mediator variable $M$, assumed continuous. Given **uncorrelated** unobserved noise variables $\\varepsilon_M$ and $\\varepsilon_Y$, we specify linear regression models,\n\\begin{align*}\nM \\mid X=x &= c_M + \\alpha x + \\varepsilon_M,\\\\\nY \\mid X=x, M=m &=  c_Y + \\beta x + \\gamma m + \\mathbf{z}^\\top\\boldsymbol{\\omega} + \\varepsilon_Y\n\\end{align*}\nwhere we use the contrast-to-reference parametrization so that the reference category for the intercept corresponds to control (group $x^*$) and $x$ the other category of interest, with $\\alpha$ capturing the difference between $x$ and $x^*$. The model for $Y \\mid X, M$ should include additional covariates $\\mathbf{z}$ to control for confounding between $M$ and $Y$ if the latter is suspected.\n\nThe parameters can be interpreted as the direct ($\\beta$), indirect ($\\alpha \\gamma$) and total ($\\beta + \\alpha \\gamma$) effects. To see this, we plug the first equation in the second and obtain the marginal model for $Y$ given treatment $X$,\n\\begin{align}\nY \\mid X=x &= \\underset{\\text{intercept}}{(c_Y + \\gamma c_M)} + \\underset{\\text{total effect}}{(\\beta + \\alpha\\gamma)}\\cdot x + \\underset{\\text{error}}{(\\gamma \\varepsilon_M + \\varepsilon_Y)}\\\\\n&= c_Y' + \\tau X + \\varepsilon_Y'\n\\end{align}\nThese parameters can be estimated using structural equation models (SEM), or more typically by running a series of linear regression (ordinary least squares).\n\nThe sequential ignorability in the linear mediation models boils down to \"no unmeasured confounders\" in the relations $X \\to Y$, $X \\to M$ and $M \\to Y$: the first two are satisfied in experimental studies due to randomization, as shown in @fig-dag1. This means $\\varepsilon_M {\\perp\\mkern-10mu\\perp} \\varepsilon_Y$ must be independent and, as a result, error terms should also be uncorrelated.\n\nIn the linear mediation model, we can estimate the conditional direct effect corresponding to the product of coefficients $\\alpha\\gamma$. Absence of mediation implies the product is zero. @Baron.Kenny:1986 recommended using Sobel's test statistic, a Wald-test of the form\n\\begin{align*}\nS  = \\frac{\\widehat{\\alpha}\\widehat{\\gamma} - 0}{\\mathsf{se}(\\widehat{\\alpha}\\widehat{\\gamma})} =  \\frac{\\widehat{\\alpha}\\widehat{\\gamma}}{\\sqrt{\\widehat{\\gamma}^2\\mathsf{Va}(\\widehat{\\alpha}) + \\widehat{\\alpha}^2\\mathsf{Va}(\\widehat{\\gamma}) + \\mathsf{Va}(\\widehat{\\gamma})\\mathsf{Va}(\\widehat{\\alpha})}} \\stackrel{\\cdot}{\\sim}\\mathsf{No}(0,1)\n\\end{align*} \nwhere $\\widehat{\\alpha}$, $\\widehat{\\gamma}$ and their variance $\\mathsf{Va}(\\widehat{\\alpha})$ and $\\mathsf{Va}(\\widehat{\\gamma})$ can be obtained from the estimated coefficients and standard errors.^[Sobel derived the asymptotic variance using a first-order Taylor series expansion assuming both $\\alpha$ and $\\gamma$ are non-zero (hence the tests!)] The Sobel's statistic $S$ is approximately standard normal in large samples, but the approximation is sometimes crude.\n\nIn the linear mediation causal model, we can estimate the total causal effect of $X$, labelled $\\tau$, by running the linear regression of $Y$ on $X$ as there is no confounding affecting treatment $X$ in a completely randomized experimental design. This strategy isn't valid with observational data unless we adjust for confounders. Under no unmeasured confounders and linearity, the product $\\alpha\\gamma$ is also equal to the difference between the total effect and the **natural direct effect**, $\\tau - \\beta$.\n\n@Baron.Kenny:1986 suggested for $X$ and $M$ continuous breaking down the task in three separate steps:\n\n1) fit a linear regression of $M$ on $X$ to estimate $\\alpha$\n2) fit a linear regression of $Y$ on $X$ to estimate $\\tau$\n3) fit a linear regression of $Y$ on $X$ and $M$ to estimate $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$.\n\nIn the \"@Baron.Kenny:1986 approach\", we test $\\mathscr{H}_0: \\alpha=0$, $\\mathscr{H}_0: \\tau=0$ and $\\mathscr{H}_0: \\gamma=0$ against the two-sided alternative. This approach has caveats since mediation refers to the relation $X \\to M \\to Y$, so we only need to consider (joint tests of) $\\alpha$ and $\\gamma$ (the total effect could be zero because $\\beta = -\\alpha\\gamma$ even if there is mediation). @Zhao.Lynch.Chen:2010 review the typology of mediation.\n\n1. complementary mediation when both direct and indirect effects are of the same sign and non-zero.\n2. competitive mediation when direct and indirect effects are of opposite signs.\n3. indirect-only mediation when the direct effect of $X \\to Y$ is null, but the effect $X \\to M \\to Y$ isn't.\n\nPrevious definitions popularized by @Baron.Kenny:1986 still found in old papers include \"full mediation\" for instances where $\\beta=0$ and partial mediation if the direct effect is less than the total effect, meaning $\\beta < \\tau$.\n\n\nTo see this, let's generate data with a binary treatment and normally distributed mediators and response with no confounding (so the data generating process matches exactly the formulation fo Baron--Kenny. We set $\\alpha=2$, $\\beta = 1/2$ and $\\gamma=0$. This is an instance where the null is true ($X$ affects both $M$ and $Y$).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='11-causal-inference_cache/html/fig-sobelsimu_2b7aba2f7839f03f32463e9decc6615d'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Null distribution of Sobel's statistic against approximate asymptotic normal distribution with 20 observations $\\alpha=0$, $\\gamma=0.1$ and normal random errors.](11-causal-inference_files/figure-html/fig-sobelsimu-1.png){#fig-sobelsimu fig-align='center' width=85%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf we knew exactly the model that generated $X$, $M$, $Y$ and the relations between them, we could simulate multiple datasets like in @fig-sobelsimu with $n=20$ observations and compare the test statistic we obtained with the simulation-based null distribution with $\\alpha\\gamma=0$. In practice we do not know the model that generated the data and furthermore we have a single dataset at hand. An alternative is the bootstrap, a form of simulation-based inference. The latter is conceptually easy to understand: we generate new datasets by resampling from the ones observed (as if it was the population). Since we want the sample size to be identical and our objective is to get heterogeneity, we sample with replacement: from one bootstrap dataset to the next, we will have multiple copies, or none, of each observation. See @Efron.Tibshirani:1993 and @Davison.Hinkley:1997 for a more thorough treatment of the bootstrap and alternative sampling schemes for regression models. The nonparametric bootstrap procedure advocated by @Preacher.Hayes:2004 consists in repeating the following $B$ times:\n\n1) sample $n$ observations **with replacement**, i.e., a tuple ($X_i, M_i, Y_i)$, from the original data .\n2) compute the natural indirect effect $\\widehat{\\alpha}\\cdot\\widehat{\\gamma}$ on each simulated sample\n\nFor a two-sided test at level $\\alpha$, compute the $\\alpha/2$ and $1-\\alpha/2$ quantiles of the bootstrap statistics $\\{\\widehat{\\alpha}_b\\widehat{\\gamma}_b\\}_{b=1}^B$. For example, if the level is $\\alpha=5$% and we generate $B=1000$ bootstrap samples, the percentile confidence intervals bounds are the 25th and 975th ordered observations.\n\nNowadays, the asymptotic approximation (sometimes misnamed delta method^[The latter is the name of the method used to derive the denominator of Sobel's statistic.]) has fallen out of fashion among practitioners, who prefer the nonparametric bootstrap coupled with the percentile method. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='11-causal-inference_cache/html/bootstrap_4446029fa504c3adb2a47178c337918f'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Bootstrap distribution of indirect effect with estimate and percentile 95% confidence intervals (vertical red lines).](11-causal-inference_files/figure-html/bootstrap-1.png){fig-align='center' width=85%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe nonparametric percentile bootstrap confidence interval for $\\alpha\\gamma$ is [-0.08, 1.71] and thus we fail to reject the null hypothesis  $\\mathscr{H}_0: \\alpha \\gamma=0$.\n\nThe inference scheme is popular, but we could also rely on different models and use the definitions of the causal effects to perform simulation-based inference; see Appendix D of @Imai:2010. The latter fit two models for the mediator and the outcome, then estimate parameters. In large samples, the parameter estimators are approximately multivariate Gaussian and we can simulate parameters, use the parametric model to generate new data and potential outcomes. The average causal mediation effect can be estimated empirically based on the simulated potential outcomes.\n\n### Model assumptions\n\nWe can unpack the model assumptions for the linear mediation model.\n\n1. The *no unmeasured confounders* assumption. Plainly stated, there are no unobserved confounders and thus the error terms $\\varepsilon_M$ and $\\varepsilon_Y$ are independent. Additionally, when we consider observational data, we must make sure there is hidden confounders affecting either the $M \\to X$ and the $X \\to Y$ relation, as shown in @fig-dag1. We can include covariates in the regression models to palliate to this, but we must only include the minimal set of confounders (and no additional mediator or collider chain). \n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='11-causal-inference_cache/html/fig-dag1_cf70bc6f20b68b771b281d4153334374'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Directed acyclic graph representing observational settings (left) and experimental settings in which assignment is random given covariates measured pre-treatments (right). The 'no unmeasured confounder' assumption postulates such confounders are included (with the correct parametric form) in the regression models.](figures/dag1.png){#fig-dag1 fig-align='center' width=85%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnother problem would be to claim that variable $M$ is a mediator when in truth part of the effect on the outcome is due to change in another mediator. @fig-dag2 shows an instance with no confounding, but multiple mediators, say $M_1$ and $M_2$: the latter mediates the relation $M_1 \\to Y$. The linear mediation model would capture the total effect of $M_1$, but it would be incorrect to claim that the mediation effect on $X$ is due to $M_1$.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='11-causal-inference_cache/html/fig-dag2_719bbda151a63d9c9e74b03885dea87f'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Directed acyclic graph showing multiple mediators.](figures/dag2.png){#fig-dag2 fig-align='center' width=45%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n2. The **linearity assumption** implies that the linear models are correctly specified and that the effect of the covariates are linear. This means that, *ceteris paribus*, the effect of an increase of one unit of $M$ on $Y$ is the same regardless of the value of $M$. It also doesn't depend on the level of other variables (no interaction). If the model isn't properly specified, the linear model coefficients will capture the best linear predictor given the design and the coefficients may not be meaningful.\n\nThe linearity assumption also implies that the effect is the same for every individual, so there is no treatment heterogeneity or measurement error which could lead to attenuation bias.\n\nFollowing @Bullock.Green.Ha:2010, we index the regression equations by individual $i$\n\\begin{align*}\nM_i\\mid X_i=x &= c_M + \\alpha_i x + \\varepsilon_{Mi},\\\\\nY_i \\mid X_i=x, M_i=m &=  c_Y + \\beta_i x + \\gamma_i m + \\mathbf{z}_i^\\top\\boldsymbol{\\omega} + \\varepsilon_{Yi}\n\\end{align*}\nIf $\\alpha_i$ differ from one observation to the next, the average estimated by the regression could be positive, negative or null. Even in the latter case, we could have $\\gamma_i$ and $\\alpha_i$ positive for some observation, or both negatives so that they cancel out even if there is complementary mediation.\n\nWe could easily expand the model to include nonlinear effects (not for the treatment or mediator) and potential interactions, but the linear model approach will be limited. @Imai:2010 details a more general approach for parametric models based on simulations, as well as a nonparametric approach. Both are less restrictive than the @Baron.Kenny:1986 model.\n\nThe main benefit of experimental designs is that it deconfounds the relation between treatment and other variables, but adding spurious variables could create feedback and lead to inconsistent conclusions. It's not clear that the mediator can be manipulated experimentally, and even if it could be to estimate the $\\gamma$, one must make sure the relation is the same absent of $X$. For example, we could estimate the indirect effect term by manipulating jointly (if possible) ($X, M$) but even then the linearity assumption must hold for the estimates to correspond to our linear causal mediation model. \n\n### Example\n\nStudy 2 of @Lee.Choi:2019 focus on inconsistency of photos and text descriptions for online descriptions and how this impact the product evaluation.\n\nThe experimental variable is the consistency of the product description and depiction, with `fluency` leading to \"processing disfluency\" that is expected to impact negatively judgment ratings.\nFamiliarity with the product brand and product is included as covariate in both mediator and outcome model (see Table 1 of @Lee.Choi:2019).^[Incidentally, reporting the coefficients allows in a Table allows one to retro-engineer the model and ensure reproducibility.]\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='11-causal-inference_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-10_86418ceff3d0da3a91ef912ec15e574b'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(LC19_S2, package = \"hecedsm\")\nYsMX <- lm(prodeval ~ fluency + consistency + familiarity,\n           data = LC19_S2)\nMsX <- lm(fluency ~ consistency + familiarity,\n           data = LC19_S2)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {#tbl-coefsmediation .cell layout-align=\"center\" tbl-cap='Coefficients of the mediation (left) and outcome (right) models.' hash='11-causal-inference_cache/html/tbl-coefsmediation_eac8caf1c10cecd8b170db6c8479866f'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"kable_wrapper table\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td> \n\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> term </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> estimate </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> std.error </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> (Intercept) </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 5.23 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.27 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> consistency </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.48 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.24 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> familiarity </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.08 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.06 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n </td>\n   <td> \n\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> term </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> estimate </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> std.error </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> (Intercept) </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 3.04 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.53 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> fluency </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.60 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.09 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> consistency </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.29 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.22 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> familiarity </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.09 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.05 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can extract the effects directly from the outcome: the natural indirect effect estimate is $\\widehat{\\alpha}\\widehat{\\gamma} = 0.48 \\times 0.60$ and the direct effect is $\\widehat{\\beta} = 0.29$.\n\nTo get confidence intervals, we can use the `mediate` package [@mediationR].

Such variables, say $W$, thus have an interactive effect with the experimental factor $X$, termed moderator in psychology.\n\nIn a blocking design, covariates are included that have an impact on the outcome to filter out variability, but with the assumption that they do not influence the effect of treatment. With moderators, we include the interaction. \n\nIf we have an experimental factor $X$ which is binary or categorical, the resulting model is a simple analysis of variance model and we can test the significance of the interaction term to assess the moderating effect of $W$.\n\nIf $W$ is a mean-centered continuous variable and $X$ a categorical variable with $k=1, \\ldots, K$ levels using the sum-to-zero parametrization, the linear model\n$$\\mathsf{E}\\{Y \\mid \\mathsf{do}(X) = k, W\\} = \\mu + \\alpha_k + (\\beta + \\gamma_k)W + \\varepsilon,$$\nincludes different slopes for $W$ in each experimental group, as well as different intercepts ($\\mu + \\alpha_k$) for group $k$. \n\nAs an example, we consider @Garcia:2010. These data are from a study on gender discrimination. Participants were put with a file where a women was turned down promotion in favour of male colleague despite her being clearly more experimented and qualified. The authors manipulated the decision of the participant to this decision, either choosing not to challenge the decision (no protest), a request to reconsider based on individual qualities of the applicants (individual) and a request to reconsider based on abilities of women (collective). All items were measured using scales constructed using items measured using Likert scales ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7).\n\nThe postulated mediator variable is `sexism`, the average of 6 Likert scales for the Modern Sexism Scale assessing pervasiveness of gender discrimination. We consider participants' evaluation of the appropriateness of the response of the fictional character.\n\nWe fit the linear model with the interaction and display the observed slopes\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='11-causal-inference_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-14_f1ab43f7b9c702613e35b8c42756f229'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(GSBE10, package = \"hecedsm\")\nlin_moder <- lm(respeval ~ protest*sexism, \n               data = GSBE10)\nsummary(lin_moder) # coefficients\ncar::Anova(lin_moder, type = 3) # tests\n```\n:::\n\n::: {#tbl-testsmoder .cell layout-align=\"center\" tbl-cap='Analysis of variance table for the linear moderation model.' hash='11-causal-inference_cache/html/tbl-testsmoder_b9da782d5771b73699b9e789921d16f8'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> term </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> sumsq </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> df </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> statistic </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> p.value </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> protest </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 6.34 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2.45 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> .091 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> sexism </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 6.59 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 5.09 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> .026 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> protest:sexism </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 12.49 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4.82 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> .010 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Residuals </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 159.22 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 123 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\">  </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\">  </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='11-causal-inference_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-16_57730c0ebe1fda1200c99c54424538d5'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](11-causal-inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){fig-align='center' width=85%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBecause of the interaction, comparing the levels of the experimental factor only makes sense if we fix the value of sexism (since the slopes are not parallel) and won't necessarily be reliable outside of the range of observed values of sexism.

More complicated mediation model could include interactions between treatment effects or moderators and covariates, with external variables, leading to moderated mediation.\n\nInteractions can be considered for pretty much any statistical model, but the usual assumptions need to hold for inference to be approximately valid.\n",
