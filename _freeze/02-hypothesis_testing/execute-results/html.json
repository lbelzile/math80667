In order to draw conclusions in favour or against a theory, researchers turn (often unwillingly) to statistics to back up their claims. This has led to the prevalence of the use of the null hypothesis statistical testing (NHST) framework. One important aspect of the reproducibility crisis is the misuse of $p$-values in journal articles: falsification of a null hypothesis is not enough to provide substantive findings for a theory.\n\n  \nBecause introductory statistics course typically present hypothesis tests without giving much thoughts to the underlying construction principles of such procedures, users often have a reductive view of statistics as a catalogue of pre-determined procedures. To make a culinary analogy, users focus on learning recipes rather than trying to understand the basics of cookery. This chapter focuses on understanding of key ideas related to testing.\n\n\n:::keyidea\n\n**Learning objectives**:\n\n* Understanding the role of uncertainty in decision making.\n* Understanding the importance of signal-to-noise ratio as a measure of evidence.\n* Knowing the basic ingredients of hypothesis testing and being capable of correctly formulating and identifying these components in a paper.\n* Correctly interpreting $p$-values and confidence intervals for a parameter.\n\n:::\n\n## Hypothesis\n\nThe first step of a design is formulating a research question. Generally, this hypothesis will specify potential differences between population characteristics due to some intervention (a treatment) that the researcher wants to quantify. This is the step during which researchers decide on sample size, choice of response variable and metric for the measurement, write down the study plan, etc.\n\nIt is important to note that most research questions cannot be answered by simple tools. Researchers wishing to perform innovative methodological research should contact experts and consult with statisticians **before** they collect their data to get information on how best to proceed for what they have in mind so as to avoid the risk of making misleading and false claims based on incorrect analysis or data collection.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='02-hypothesis_testing_cache/html/fig-xkcd2569_6fc3408d60f6e3fcfdd41f6cbc7e1733'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![xkcd comic [2569 (Hypothesis generation) by Randall Munroe](https://xkcd.com/2569/).

We can characterize the set of all potential values their measurements can take, together with their frequency, via a distribution. \n\nThe purpose of this section is to illustrate how we cannot simply use raw differences between groups to make meaningful comparisons: due to sampling variability, samples will be alike even if they are generated in the same way, but there will be always be differences between their summary statistics. Such differences tend to attenuate (or increase) as we collect more sample. Inherent to this is the fact that as we gather more data (and thus more information) about our target, the portrait becomes more precise. This is ultimately what allows us to draw meaningful conclusions but, in order to do so, we need first to determine what is likely or plausible and could be a stroke of luck, and what is not likely to occur solely due to randomness.\n\n\n::: {#exm-ABtest}\n\n## A/B testing\n\nConsider two webpage design: one is the current version (*status quo*) and the other implementation contains a clickable banner in a location where eyetracker suggest that viewers eyes spend more time or attention. The number of clicks on those headlines are what generate longer viewing, and thus higher revenues from advertisement. The characteristic of interest here would be the average click conversation rate for each of the webpage design.\n\nIt is fairly simple to redirect traffic so that a random fraction gets assigned to the new design for study. After a suitable period of time, the data can be analyzed to see if the new webpage generates more clicks.\n\n:::\n\nAn hypothesis test will focus on one or multiple of these characteristics. Suppose for simplicity that we have only two groups, control and treatment, whose population averages are $\\mu_C$ and $\\mu_T$ we wish to compare. People commonly look at the difference in average, say $\\delta=\\mu_T - \\mu_C$ as a measure of the effectiveness of the treatment.^[We could look at the ratio $\\mu_T/\\mu_C$ instead.] If we properly randomized observations in each subgroup and nothing else changes, then this measures the impact of the treatment. Because we only have a sample at hand and not the whole population, we don't know for sure the values of $\\mu_C$ and $\\mu_T$. These quantities exist, but are unknown to us so the best we can do is estimate them using our sample. If we have a random sample from the population, then the characteristics of the sample will be (noisy) proxys of those of the population.\n\n\nWe call numerical summaries of the data **statistics**. Its important to distinguish between procedures/formulas and their numerical values. An **estimator** is a rule or formula used to calculate an estimate of some parameter or quantity of interest based on observed data (like a recipe for cake). Once we have observed data we can actually compute the sample mean, that is, we have an estimate --- an actual value (the cake), which is a single realization and not random. In other words,\n\n- an estimand is our conceptual target, like the population characteristic of interest (population mean).\n- an estimator is the procedure or formula telling us how to transform the sample data into a numerical summary that is a proxy of our target.\n- an estimate is a number, the numerical value obtained once we apply the formula to observed data.\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-cake .cell layout-ncol=\"3\" layout-align=\"center\" hash='02-hypothesis_testing_cache/html/fig-cake_4e39be3b002e14923899805df9b209bf'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Estimand](figures/estimand.jpg){#fig-cake-1 fig-align='center' width=33%}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Estimator](figures/estimator.jpg){#fig-cake-2 fig-align='center' width=33%}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Estimate](figures/estimate.jpg){#fig-cake-3 fig-align='center' width=33%}\n:::\n\n[Estimand](https://www.flickr.com/photos/darkdwarf/16563489881) (left), estimator (middle) and [estimate](https://www.flickr.com/photos/bensutherland/14685548773) (right) illustrated with cakes and based on an original idea of Simon Grund.

Thus, sampling variability implies that the sample means of the subgroups will always differ even if they share the same characteristics. You can view sampling variability as noise: our goal is to extract the signal (typically differences in means) but accounting for spurious results due to the background noise.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='02-hypothesis_testing_cache/html/fig-samplevar_6568dcfab139e4234f3a6556292b7b7e'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Five samples of size $n=10$ drawn from a common population with mean $\\mu$ (horizontal line). The colored segments show the sample means of each sample.](02-hypothesis_testing_files/figure-html/fig-samplevar-1.png){#fig-samplevar fig-align='center' width=85%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can clearly see from @fig-samplevar that, even if each sample is drawn from the same population, the sample mean varies from one sample to the next as a result of the sampling variability. The astute eye might even notice that the sample means are less dispersed around the full black horizontal line representing the population average $\\mu$ than are the individual measurements. This is a fundamental principle of statistics: information accumulates as you get more data.\n\nValues of the sample mean don't tell the whole picture and studying differences in mean (between groups, or relative to a postulated reference value) is not enough to draw conclusions. In most settings, there is no guarantee that the sample mean will be equal to it's true value because it changes from one sample to the next: the only guarantee we have is that it will be on average equal to the population average in repeated samples. Depending on the choice of measurement and variability in the population, there may be considerable differences from one observation to the next and this means the observed difference could be a fluke.\n\n\nTo get an idea of how certain something is, we have to consider the variability of an observation $Y_i$. This variance of an observation drawn from the population is typically denoted $\\sigma^2$ and it's square root, the standard deviation, by $\\sigma$. \n\nThe sample variance $S_n$ is an estimator of the standard deviation $\\sigma$, where \n\\begin{align*}\nS^2_n &= \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i-\\overline{Y})^2\n\\end{align*} \nis the sum of squared difference between observations and the sample average, scaled by a factor proportional to the sample size.\n\n\nThe standard deviation *of a statistic* is termed **standard error**; it should not be confused with the standard deviation $\\sigma$ of the population from which the sample observations $Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n$ are drawn. Both standard deviation and standard error are expressed in the same units as the measurements, so are easier to interpret than variance. Since the standard error is a function of the sample size, it is however good practice to report the estimated standard deviation in reports.\n\n::: {#exm-samppropunif}\n\n## Sample proportion and uniform draws\n\nTo illustrate the concept of sampling variability, we follow the lead of [Matthew Crump](https://www.crumplab.com/statistics/foundations-for-inference.html) and consider samples from a uniform distribution on $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 10\\}$ each number in this interval is equally likely to be sampled. \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='02-hypothesis_testing_cache/html/fig-unifsamp1_2d8a7de58526dd0e13d153f62bc76a1e'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Histograms for 10 random samples of size $n=20$ from a discrete uniform distribution.](02-hypothesis_testing_files/figure-html/fig-unifsamp1-1.png){#fig-unifsamp1 fig-align='center' width=85%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nEven if they are drawn from the same population, the 10 samples in @fig-unifsamp1 look quite different. The only thing at play here is the sample variability: since there are $n=20$ observations in total, there should be on average 10% of the observations in each of the 10 bins, but some bins are empty and others have more counts than expected. This fluctuation is due to randomness, or chance. \n\nHow can we thus detect whether what we see is compatible with the model we think generated the data? The key is to collect more observations: the bar height is the sample proportion, an average of 0/1 values with ones indicating that the observation is in the bin and zero otherwise.\n\nConsider now what happens as we increase the sample size: the top panel of @fig-uniformsamp2 shows uniform samples for increasing samples size. The histogram looks more and more like the true underlying distribution (flat, each bin with equal frequency) as the sample size increases. The sample distribution of points is nearly indistinguishable from the theoretical one (straight line) when $n=10 000$.^[The formula shows that the standard error decreases by a tenfold every time the sample size increases by a factor 100.] The bottom panel, on the other hand, isn't from a uniform distribution and larger samples come closer to the population distribution. We couldn't have spotted this difference in the first two plots, since the sampling variability is too important; there, the lack of data in some bins could have been attributed to chance, as they are comparable with the graph for data that are truly uniform. This is in line with most practical applications, in which the limited sample size restricts our capacity to disentangle real differences from sampling variability. We must embrace this uncertainty:  in the next section, we outline how hypothesis testing helps us disentangle the signal from the noise.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='02-hypothesis_testing_cache/html/fig-uniformsamp2_ddbd216e2e60cc9cfd5cfc2af2a36f06'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Histograms of data from a uniform distribution (top) and non-uniform (bottom) with increasing sample sizes of 10, 100, 1000 and 10 000 (from left to right).](02-hypothesis_testing_files/figure-html/fig-uniformsamp2-1.png){#fig-uniformsamp2 fig-align='center' width=85%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Hypothesis testing {#tests}\n\nAn hypothesis test is a binary decision rule (yes/no) used to evaluate the statistical evidence provided by a sample to make a decision regarding the underlying population. The main steps involved are:\n\n- define the model parameters\n- formulate the alternative and null hypothesis\n- choose and calculate the test statistic\n- obtain the null distribution describing the behaviour of the test statistic under $\\mathscr{H}_0$\n- calculate the _p_-value\n- conclude (reject or fail to reject $\\mathscr{H}_0$) in the context of the problem.\n\nA good analogy for hypothesis tests is a trial for murder on which you are appointed juror.\n\n- The judge lets you choose between two mutually exclusive outcome, guilty or not guilty, based on the evidence presented in court.\n- The presumption of innocence applies and evidences are judged under this optic: are evidence remotely plausible if the person was innocent?  The burden of the proof lies with the prosecution to avoid as much as possible judicial errors. The null hypothesis $\\mathscr{H}_0$ is *not guilty*, whereas the alternative $\\mathscr{H}_a$ is *guilty*. If there is a reasonable doubt, the verdict of the trial will be not guilty.\n- The test statistic (and the choice of test) represents the summary of the proof. The more overwhelming the evidence, the higher the chance the accused will be declared guilty. The prosecutor chooses the proof so as to best outline this: the choice of evidence (statistic) ultimately will maximize the evidence, which parallels the power of the test.\n- The null distribution is the benchmark against which to judge the evidence (jurisprudence). Given the proof, what are the odds assuming the person is innocent? Since this is possibly different for every test, it is common to report instead a _p_-value, which gives the level of evidence on a uniform scale which is most easily interpreted.\n- The final step is the verdict, a binary decision with outcomes: guilty or not guilty. For an hypothesis test performed at level $\\alpha$, one would reject (guilty) if the _p_-value is less than $\\alpha$. Even if we declare the person not guilty, this doesn't mean the defendant is innocent and vice-versa.\n\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nIn statistical tests we have two hypotheses: the null hypothesis ($\\mathscr{H}_0$) and the alternative hypothesis ($\\mathscr{H}_a$). Usually, the null hypothesis (the 'status quo') is a single numerical value. The alternative is what we're really interested in testing. In @fig-samplevar, we could consider whether all five groups have the same mean $\\mathscr{H}_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\cdots = \\mu_5$ against the alternative that at least two of them are different. These two outcomes are mutually exclusive and cover all possible scenarios. A statistical hypothesis test allows us to decide whether or not our data provides enough evidence to reject $\\mathscr{H}_0$ in favor of $\\mathscr{H}_a$, subject to some pre-specified risk of error: while we know that the differences are just due to sampling variability in @fig-samplevar because the data is simulated, in practice we need to assess the evidence using a numerical summary. \n\n\n::: {#exm-abtest-cont}\n\n## A/B testing (continued)\n\nWe follow-up with our A/B test experiment. Given $\\mu_1$ the population average click conversation rate for the current webpage and $\\mu_2$, that of the redesign, we are interested in the *one-sided hypothesis* that $\\mathscr{H}_0: \\mu_2 \\leq \\mu_1$ against the alternative (that we are trying to prove) $\\mathscr{H}_a: \\mu_2 > \\mu_1$. In choosing as null hypothesis that the new design is no better or worst, we are putting all our weight to make sure the changes carry forward if there is overwhelming evidence that the new design is better and allow us to generate more revenues, given the costs associated to changes to the interface and the resulting disruption.\n\nOne-sided hypothesis are directional: we care only about a specific direction, and so here $\\mathscr{H}_a: \\mu_2 > \\mu_1$. Indeed, if the experiment suggests that the conversion rate is worst with the new webpage design, we won't go forward.\n\nSince neither of these population averages $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$ are known to us, we can work instead with $\\mathscr{H}_0: \\mu_2-\\mu_1 \\geq 0$. We can use as estimator for the difference $\\mu_2-\\mu_1$ the difference in sample average in each subgroup.\n\nThe null hypothesis here is an interval, but it suffices the consider the most beneficial scenario, which is $\\mu_2-\\mu_1=0$. Indeed, if we can disprove that there is no difference and see an increase of the click rate with the updated version, all more extreme cases are automatically discarded in favour of the alternative that the new design is better.\n\nOne-sided tests for which the evidence runs contrary to the hypothesis (say the mean conversion rate is higher for the current design than for the new one) lead to _p_-values of 1, since there is no proof against the null hypothesis that the old design (the status quo) is better.\n\n:::\n\nThe previous example illustrates the fact that, when writing down null and alternative hypotheses, what we are trying to prove is typically the alternative. \n\nIn pairwise comparisons or contrasts, we can assign a directionality. The benefit is that, if we are sure of the direction of the postulated effect, we only consider as extreme scenarios that run in the direction we postulated^[This implies that the level $\\alpha$ is all on one side, rather than split equally between both tails of the distribution. In practice, this translates into increased power of detection provided the effect is in the postulated direction.] However, if the empirical evidence runs contrary to our guess, then there is no support for the hypothesis.\n\nIn more general statistical models, it helps to view the null hypothesis as a simplification of a more complex model: the latter will fit the data better because it is more flexible, but we would fail to reject the null unless this improvement is drastic. For example, in an analysis of variance model, we compare different mean in each of $K$ groups against a single common average. \n\n### Test statistic\n\nA test statistic $T$ is a function of the data which takes the data as input and outputs a summary of the information contained in the sample for a characteristic of interest, say the population mean.  In order to assess whether the numerical value for $T$ is unusual, we need to know what are the potential values taken by $T$ and their relative probability if $\\mathscr{H}_0$ is true. We need to know what values we should expect  if, e.g., there was no difference in the averages of the different groups: this requires a benchmark.\n\n\nMany statistics we will consider are of the form^[This class of statistic, which includes $t$-tests, are called Wald statistics.]\n\\begin{align*}\nT = \\frac{\\text{estimated effect}- \\text{postulated effect}}{\\text{estimated effect variability}} = \\frac{\\widehat{\\theta} - \\theta_0}{\\mathrm{se}(\\widehat{\\theta})}\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $\\widehat{\\theta}$ is an estimator of $\\theta$, $\\theta_0$ is the postulated value of the parameter and  $\\mathrm{se}(\\widehat{\\theta})$ is the standard error of the test statistic $\\widehat{\\theta}$. This quantity is designed so that, if our postulated value $\\theta_0$ is correct, $T$ has approximately mean zero and variance one. This standardization makes comparison easier; in fact, the form of the test statistic is chosen so that it doesn't depend on the measurement units.\n\nFor example, if we are interested in mean differences between treatment group and control group, denoted $\\mu_T$ and $\\mu_C$, then $\\theta = \\mu_T-\\mu_C$ and  $\\mathscr{H}_0: \\mu_T = \\mu_C$ corresponds to $\\mathscr{H}_0: \\theta = 0$ for no difference. The two-sample $t$-test would have numerator $\\widehat{\\theta} = \\overline{Y}_T - \\overline{Y}_C$, where $\\overline{Y}_T$ is the sample average in treatment group and $\\overline{Y}_C$ that of the control group. The postulated value for the mean difference is zero.\n\nThe numerator would thus consist of the difference in sample means and the denominator the standard error of that quantity, calculated using a software.^[Assuming equal variance, the denominator is estimated using the pooled variance estimator.]\n\n\n\n### Null distribution and _p_-value\n\nThe _p_-value allows us to decide whether the observed value of the test statistic $T$ is plausible under $\\mathscr{H}_0$. Specifically, the _p_-value is the probability that the test statistic is equal or more extreme to the estimate computed from the data, assuming $\\mathscr{H}_0$ is true. Suppose that based on a random sample $Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n$ we obtain a statistic whose value $T=t$. For a two-sided test $\\mathscr{H}_0:\\theta=\\theta_0$ vs. $\\mathscr{H}_a:\\theta \\neq \\theta_0$, the _p_-value is $\\mathsf{Pr}_0(|T| \\geq |t|)$.^[If the distribution of $T$ is symmetric around zero, the _p_-value reduces to $p = 2 \\times \\mathsf{Pr}_0(T \\geq |t|).$]\n\nHow do we determine the null distribution given that the true data generating mechanism is unknown to us? We ask a statistician! In simple cases, it might be possible to enumerate all possible outcomes and thus quantity the degree of outlyingness of our observed statistic. In more general settings, we can resort to simulations or to probability theory: the central limit theorem says that the sample mean behaves like a normal random variable with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}$ for $n$ large enough. The central limit theorem has broader applications since most statistics can be viewed as some form of average or transformation thereof, a fact used to derive benchmarks for most commonly used tests. Most software use these approximations as proxy by default: the normal, Student's $t$, $\\chi^2$ and $F$ distributions are the reference distributions that arise the most often. \n\n@fig-power-plots shows the distribution of $p$-values for two scenarios: one in which there are no differences and the null is true, the other under an alternative. The probability of rejection is obtained by calculating the area under the density curve between zero and $\\alpha=0.1$, here\n0.1 on the left. Under the null, the model is calibrated and the distribution of _p_-values\nis uniform (i.e., a flat rectangle of height 1), meaning all values in the unit  interval are equally likely. Under the alternative (right), small _p_-values are more likely to be observed.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='02-hypothesis_testing_cache/html/fig-power-plots_83a13a84b8829bc0d3404d6240425198'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Density of _p_-values under the null hypothesis (left) and under an alternative with a signal-to-noise ratio of 0.5 (right).](02-hypothesis_testing_files/figure-html/fig-power-plots-1.png){#fig-power-plots fig-align='center' width=85%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThere are generally three ways of obtaining null distributions for assessing the degree of evidence against the null hypothesis\n\n- exact calculations\n- large sample theory (aka 'asymptotics' in statistical lingo)\n- simulation\n\nWhile desirable, the first method is only applicable in simple cases (such as counting the probability of getting two six if you throw two fair die). The second method is most commonly used due to its generality and ease of use (particularly in older times where computing power was scarce), but fares poorly with small sample sizes (where 'too small' is context and test-dependent). The last approach can be used to approximate the null distribution in many scenarios, but adds a layer of randomness and the extra computations costs sometimes are not worth it. \n\n### Conclusion\n\n\nThe *p*-value allows us to make a decision about the null hypothesis. If $\\mathscr{H}_0$ is true, the *p*-value follows a uniform distribution, as shown in @fig-power-plots. [Thus, if the *p*-value is small](https://xkcd.com/1478/), this means observing an outcome more extreme than $T=t$ is unlikely, and so we're inclined to think that $\\mathscr{H}_0$ is not true. There's always some underlying risk that we're making a mistake when we make a decision. In statistic, there are [two type of errors](https://xkcd.com/2303/):\n\n\n- type I error: we reject the null hypothesis $\\mathscr{H}_0$ when the null is true,\n- type II error: we fail to reject the null hypothesis $\\mathscr{H}_0$ when the alternative is true.\n\nThe two hypothesis are not judged equally: we seek to avoid error of type I (judicial errors, corresponding to condamning an innocent). To prevent this, we fix a the level of the test, $\\alpha$, which captures our tolerance to the risk of commiting a type I error: the higher the level of the test $\\alpha$, the more often we will reject the null hypothesis when the latter is true. The value of $\\alpha \\in (0, 1)$ is the probability of rejecting $\\mathscr{H}_0$ when $\\mathscr{H}_0$ is in fact true,\n\\begin{align*}\n\\alpha = \\mathsf{Pr}_0\\left(\\text{ reject } \\mathscr{H}_0\\right).\n\\end{align*}\nThe level $\\alpha$ is fixed beforehand, typically $1$\\%, $5$\\% or $10$\\%. Keep in mind that the probability of type I error is $\\alpha$ only if the null model for $\\mathscr{H}_0$ is correct (sic) and correspond to the data generating mechanism.\n\n\nThe focus on type I error is best understood by thinking about costs of moving away from the status quo: a new website design or branding will be costly to implement, so you want to make sure there are enough evidence that the proposal is the better alternative and will lead to increased traffic or revenues.\n\n\n| **Decision** \\\\ **true model** | $\\mathscr{H}_0$ | $\\mathscr{H}_a$ |\n| :-- | :-: | :-: |\n| fail to reject $\\mathscr{H}_0$ | $\\checkmark$ | type II error |\n| reject $\\mathscr{H}_0$ |type I error | $\\checkmark$|\n\nTo make a decision, we compare our *p*-value $P$ with the level of the test $\\alpha$:\n\n- if $P < \\alpha$, we reject $\\mathscr{H}_0$;\n- if $P \\geq \\alpha$, we fail to reject $\\mathscr{H}_0$.\n\nDo not mix up level of the test (a probability fixed beforehand by the researcher) and the *p*-value.

The sample proportion for male is 32/42 = ~76\\%, compared to 19/49 or ~49\\% for female. While it seems that this difference of 16\\% is large, it could be spurious: the standard error for the sample proportions is roughly 3.2\\% for male and 3.4\\% for female. \n\nIf there was no discrimination based on sex, we would expect the proportion of people promoted to be the same overall; this is 51/93 =0.55 for the pooled sample. We could simply do a test for the mean difference, but rely instead on the Pearson contingency $X^2_p$ (aka chi-square) test, which compares the expected counts (based on equal promotion rates) to the observed counts, suitably standardized. If the discrepancy is large between expected and observed, than this casts doubt on the validity of the null hypothesis.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='02-hypothesis_testing_cache/html/example-chisq-test-rosen_c3271989fa6bf9379774b336f97884e1'}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nIf the counts of each cell are large, the null distribution of the chi-square test is well approximated by a $\\chi^2$ distribution.

The numerical value of Fisher's exact test statistic is different from that of the chi-square test for contingency tables, but so is the null distribution^[The null distribution for Fisher's exact test is hypergeometric.

In general, the  presentation should explicitly state the name of the test statistic employed, the sample size, mean and variance estimates, the null distribution used to assess significance and its parameters, if any. Without these, we are left to speculate.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Confidence intervals\n\n\n\nA **confidence interval** is an alternative way to present the conclusions of an hypothesis test performed at significance level $\\alpha$ by giving a range of all values for which the null isn't rejected at the chosen level. It is often combined with a point estimator $\\hat{\\theta}$ to give an indication of the variability of the estimation procedure. Wald-based  $(1-\\alpha)$ confidence intervals for a parameter  $\\theta$ are of the form\n\\begin{align*}\n\\widehat{\\theta} + \\text{critical value} \\; \\mathrm{se}(\\widehat{\\theta})\n\\end{align*}\nbased on the Wald statistic $W$,\n\\begin{align*}\nW =\\frac{\\widehat{\\theta}-\\theta}{\\mathrm{se}(\\widehat{\\theta})},\n\\end{align*}\nand where $\\theta$ represents the postulated value for the fixed, but unknown value of the parameter. The critical values  are quantile of the null distribution  and are chosen so that the probability of being more extreme is $\\alpha$. \n\nThe bounds of the confidence intervals are random variables, since both estimators of the parameter and its standard error, $\\widehat{\\theta}$ and $\\mathrm{se}(\\widehat{\\theta})$, are random: their values will vary from one sample to the next.\n\n\n\nFor generic random samples, there is a $1-\\alpha$ probability that $\\theta$ is contained in the **random** confidence interval computed. Once we obtain a sample and calculate the confidence interval, there is no more notion of probability: the true value of the parameter $\\theta$ is either inside the confidence interval or not. We can interpret confidence interval's as follows: if we were to repeat the experiment multiple times, and calculate a $1-\\alpha$ confidence interval each time, then roughly $1-\\alpha$ of the calculated confidence intervals would contain the true value of $\\theta$ in repeated samples (in the same way, if you flip a coin, there is roughly a 50-50 chance of getting heads or tails, but any outcome will be either). Our confidence is in the *procedure* we use to calculate confidence intervals and not in the actual values we obtain from a sample.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='02-hypothesis_testing_cache/html/intconf_1e8cb7b0f8489ec1bb09bc59d16cc9a4'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![95\\% confidence intervals for the mean of a standard normal population for 100 random samples.

Whereas the $1-\\alpha$ confidence interval gives the set of all values for which the test statistic doesn't provide enough evidence to reject  $\\mathscr{H}_0$ at level $\\alpha$, the *p*-value gives the probability under the null of obtaining a result more extreme than the postulated value and so is more precise for this particular value. If the *p*-value is smaller than $\\alpha$, our null value $\\theta$ will be outside of the confidence interval and vice-versa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#exm-LiuRimMinMin2022E1}\n\n## \"The Surprise of Reaching Out\"\n\n@Liu.Rim.Min.Min:2022 studies social interactions and the impact of surprise on people reaching out if this contact is unexpected.
