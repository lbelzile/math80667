In many instances, it may be possible to randomly assign multiple conditions to each experimental unit. For example, an individual coming to a lab to perform tasks in a virtual reality environment may be assigned to all treatments, the latter being presented in random order to avoid confounding. There is an obvious benefit to doing so, as the participants can act as their own control group, leading to greater comparability among treatment conditions. \n\n\n\n\nFor example, consider a study performed at Tech3Lab that looks at the reaction time for people texting or talking on a cellphone while walking. We may wish to determine whether disengagement is slower for people texting, yet we may also postulate that some elderly people have slower reflexes.\n\n\nIn a between-subjects design, subjects are **nested** within experimental condition, as a subject can only be assigned a single treatment. In a within-subjects designs, experimental factors and subjects are **crossed**: it is possible to observed all combination of subject and experimental conditions.\n\n\nBy including multiple conditions, we can filter out effect due to subject, much like with blocking: this leads to increased precision of effect sizes and increased power (as we will see, hypothesis tests are based on within-subject variability). Together, this translates into the need to gather fewer observations or participants to detect a given effect in the population and thus experiments are cheaper to run.\n\nThere are of course drawbacks to gathering repeated measures from individuals. Because subjects are confronted with multiple tasks, there may be carryover effects (when one task influences the response of the subsequent ones, for example becoming more fluent as manipulations go on), period effects (practice of fatigue, e.g., leading to a decrease in acuity), permanent changes in the subject condition after a treatment or attrition (loss of subjects over time).\n\nTo minimize potential biases, there are multiple strategies one can use. While can randomize the order of treatment conditions among subjects to reduce confounding, or use a balanced crossover design and include the period and carryover effect in the statistical model via control variables so as to better isolate the treatment effect. The experimenter should also allow enough time between treatment conditions to reduce or eliminate period or carryover effects and plan tasks accordingly.\n\n\nDue to fatigue or learning effects, randomization of the order of the within-subject experimental conditions. If each is assigned a single time, one good way to do this is via **counterbalancing**. We proceed as follows: first, enumerate all possible orders of the condition and then assign participants as equally as possible between conditions. For example, with a single within-factor design with three conditions $A, B, C$, we have six possible orderings (either $ABC$, $ACB$, $BAC$, $BCA$, $CAB$ or $CBA$). Much like other forms of randomization, this helps us remove confounding effects and let's us estimate what is the average effect of task ordering on the response. \n\nThere are multiple approaches to handling repeated measures. The first option is to take averages over experimental condition per subject and treat them as additional blocking factors, but it may be necessary to adjust the resulting statistics. The second approach consists in fitting a multivariate model for the response and explicitly account for the correlation, otherwise the null distribution commonly used are off and so are the conclusions, as illustrated with the absurd comic displayed in @fig-xkcd2569. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='09-repeated_cache/html/fig-xkcd2569_f3049fa389b48f5e116a5f446b1d1adf'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![xkcd comic [2533 (Slope Hypothesis Testing) by Randall Munroe](https://xkcd.com/2533/).

While we can benefit from the correlation and find differences that wouldn't be detected from univariate models, the additional parameters to estimate lead to a loss of power. Finally, the most popular method nowadays for handling repeated measures is to fit a mixed model, with random effects accounting to subject-specific characteristics. By doing so, we assume that the levels of a factor (here the subject identifiers) form a random sample from a large population. These models can be difficult to fit and one needs to take great care in specifying the model. \n\n\n## Repeated measures\n\nWe introduce the concept of repeated measure and within-subject ANOVA with an example.\n\n:::{ .example name=\"Happy fakes\"}\nWe consider an experiment conducted in a graduate course at HEC, *Information Technologies and Neuroscience*, in which PhD students gathered electroencephalography (EEG) data. The project focused on human perception of deepfake image created by a generative adversarial network: Amirabdolahian and Ali-Adeeb (2021) expected the attitude towards real and computer generated image of people smiling to change.\n\nThe response variable is the amplitude of a brain signal measured at 170 ms after the participant has been exposed to different faces. Repeated measures were collected on 9 participants given in the database `AA21`, who were expected to look at 120 faces. Not all participants completed the full trial, as can be checked by looking at the cross-tabs of the counts\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='09-repeated_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_95ab4641c6c4609e198db616293e15cb'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(AA21, package = \"hecedsm\")\nxtabs(~stimulus + id, data = AA21)\n#>         id\n#> stimulus  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12\n#>     real 30 32 34 32 38 29 36 36 40 30 39 33\n#>     GAN1 32 31 40 33 38 29 39 31 39 28 35 34\n#>     GAN2 31 33 37 34 38 29 34 36 40 33 35 32\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe experimental manipulation is encoded in the `stimuli`, with levels control (`real`) for real facial images, whereas the others were generated using a generative adversarial network (GAN) with be slightly smiling (`GAN1`) or extremely smiling (`GAN2`); the latter looks more fake. While the presentation order was randomized, the order of presentation of the faces within each type is recorded using the `epoch` variable: this allows us to measure the fatigue effect.\n\nSince our research question is whether images generated from generative adversarial networks trigger different reactions, we will be looking at pairwise differences with the control.\n\n\n::: {#fig-GANfaces .cell layout-ncol=\"3\" layout-align=\"center\" hash='09-repeated_cache/html/fig-GANfaces_e2e11d12e45e12cbe2c912a13e88b7bc'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![real](figures/face_real.png){#fig-GANfaces-1 fig-align='center' width=25%}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![slightly modified](figures/face_GAN_S.png){#fig-GANfaces-2 fig-align='center' width=25%}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![extremely modified](figures/face_GAN_E.png){#fig-GANfaces-3 fig-align='center' width=25%}\n:::\n\nExample of faces presented in Amirabdolahian and Ali-Adeeb (2021).\n:::\n\n\nWe could first grouping the data and compute the average for each experimental condition `stimulus` per participant and set `id` as blocking factor. The analysis of variance table obtained from `aov` would be correct, but would fail to account for correlation. \n\n\n\nThe one-way analysis of variance with $n_s$ subjects, each of which was exposed to the $n_a$ experimental conditions, can be written \n\\begin{align*}\\underset{\\text{response}\\vphantom{l}}{Y_{ij}} = \\underset{\\text{global mean}}{\\mu_{\\vphantom{j}}} + \\underset{\\text{mean difference}}{\\alpha_j} + \\underset{\\text{subject difference}}{s_{i\\vphantom{j}}} + \\underset{\\text{error}\\vphantom{l}}{\\varepsilon_{ij}}\n\\end{align*}\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='09-repeated_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-5_f92ea82a5953799c245964b9adcf51de'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Compute mean for each subject + \n# experimental condition subgroup\nAA21_m <- AA21 |>\n  dplyr::group_by(id, stimulus) |>\n  dplyr::summarize(latency = mean(latency))\n# Use aov for balanced sample\nfixedmod <- aov(\n  latency ~ stimulus + Error(id/stimulus), \n  data = AA21_m)\n# Print ANOVA table\nsummary(fixedmod)\n#> \n#> Error: id\n#>           Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)\n#> Residuals 11    188    17.1               \n#> \n#> Error: id:stimulus\n#>           Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)\n#> stimulus   2    1.9    0.97     0.5   0.62\n#> Residuals 22   43.0    1.96\n```\n:::\n\n\nSince the design is balanced after averaging, we can use `aov` in **R**: we need to specify the subject identifier within `Error` term. This approach has a drawback, as variance components can be negative if the variability due to subject is negligible. While `aov` is fast, it only works for simple balanced designs. \n\n\n:::\n\n### Contrasts \n\nWith balanced data, the estimated marginal means coincide with the row averages. If we have a single replication or the average for each subject/condition, we could create a new column with the contrast and then fit a model with an intercept-only (global mean) to check whether the latter is zero. With 12 participants, we should thus expect our test statistic to have 11 degrees of freedom, since one unit is spent on estimating the mean parameter and we have 12 participants.\n\nUnfortunately, the `emmeans` package analysis for object fitted using `aov` will be incorrect: this can be seen by passing a contrast vector and inspecting the degrees of freedom. The `afex` package includes functionalities that are tailored for within-subject and between-subjects and has an interface with `emmeans`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='09-repeated_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-6_bf60bcfd360640474ad7848fc81f2983'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nafexmod <- afex::aov_ez(\n  id = \"id\",           # subject id\n  dv = \"latency\",      # response variable\n  within = \"stimulus\", # within-subject factor\n  data = AA21,\n  fun_aggregate = mean)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='09-repeated_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-7_e683729afb00c53f599c0c6bfe33f298'}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nThe `afex` package has different functions for computing the within-subjects design and the `aov_ez` specification, which allow people to list within and between-subjects factor separately with subject identifiers may be easier to understand.

We equally require the correlation between measurements of the same subject to be the same, an assumption that corresponds to the so-called compound symmetry model.^[Note that, with two measurements, there is a single correlation parameter to estimate and this assumption is irrelevant.]\n\nWhat if the within-subject measurements have unequal variance or the correlation between those responses differs? \n\nSince we care only about differences in treatment, can get away with a weaker assumption than compound symmetry (equicorrelation) by relying instead on *sphericity*, which holds if the variance of the difference between treatment is constant. Sphericity is not a relevant concept when there is only two measurements (as there is a single correlation); we could check this by comparing the fit of a model with an unstructured covariance (difference variances for each  and correlations for each pair of variable)\n\n\nThe most popular approach to handling correlation in tests is a two-stage approach: first, check for sphericity (using, e.g., Mauchly's test of sphericity). If the null hypothesis of sphericity is rejected, one can use a correction for the $F$ statistic by modifying the parameters of the Fisher $\\mathsf{F}$ null distribution used as benchmark.\n\n\nAn idea due to Box is to correct the degrees of freedom of the $\\mathsf{F}(\\nu_1, \\nu_2)$ distribution by multiplying them by a common factor $\\epsilon<1$ and use $\\mathsf{F}(\\epsilon\\nu_1, \\epsilon\\nu_2)$. Since the $F$ statistic is a ratio of variances, the $\\epsilon$ term would cancel. Using the scaled $\\mathsf{F}$ distribution leads to larger $p$-values, thus accounting for the correlation.\n\nThere are three widely used corrections: Greenhouse--Geisser, Huynh--Feldt and Box correction, which divides by $\\nu_1$ both degrees of freedom and gives a very conservative option. The Huynh--Feldt method is reported to be more powerful so should be preferred, but the estimated value of $\\epsilon$ can be larger than 1.\n\nUsing the `afex` functions, we get the result for Mauchly's test of sphericity and the $p$ values from using either correction method\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='09-repeated_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-9_f3fe9f05fadf0cc038f898ee9aef1d5e'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(afexmod)\n#> \n#> Univariate Type III Repeated-Measures ANOVA Assuming Sphericity\n#> \n#>             Sum Sq num Df Error SS den Df F value  Pr(>F)    \n#> (Intercept)   4073      1      188     11   238.6 8.4e-09 ***\n#> stimulus         2      2       43     22     0.5    0.62    \n#> ---\n#> Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n#> \n#> \n#> Mauchly Tests for Sphericity\n#> \n#>          Test statistic p-value\n#> stimulus          0.678   0.143\n#> \n#> \n#> Greenhouse-Geisser and Huynh-Feldt Corrections\n#>  for Departure from Sphericity\n#> \n#>          GG eps Pr(>F[GG])\n#> stimulus  0.757       0.57\n#> \n#>          HF eps Pr(>F[HF])\n#> stimulus  0.851      0.587\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::{ .example name=\"Visual acuity\"}\n\nWe consider a model with both within-subject and between-subject factors. Data for a study on visual acuity of participants. The data represent the number of words correctly detected at different font size; interest is in effect of illusory contraction on detection.  The mixed analysis of variance includes the experimental factors `adaptation` (2 levels, within), `fontsize` (4 levels, within), `position` (5 levels, within) and visual  `acuity` (2 levels, between). There are a total of 1760 measurements for 44 participants in `LBJ17_S1A`, balanced.\nThe within-subject factors give a total of 40 measurements ($2 \\times 4 \\times 5$) per participant; all of these factors are crossed and we can estimate interactions for them. The subjects are nested within visual acuity groups, The participants were dichotomized in two groups based on their visual acuity, obtained from preliminary checks, using a median split.\n\nTo fit the model, we rely on the `aov_ez` function from `afex`.

manipulated at once, and all interactions of order two, three and four are included!\n\nThe fourth order interaction isn't statistically significant: this means that we can legitimately marginalize over and look at each of the four three-way ANOVA designs in turn. We can also see that the third order interaction `adaptation:fontsize:position` and `acuity:adaptation:position ` are not really meaningful. \n\nThe following paragraph is technical and can be skipped. One difficult bit with designs including both within-subject and between-subject factors is the degrees of freedom and the correct sum of square terms to use to calculate the $F$ statistics for each hypothesis of interest. The correct setup is to use the next sum of square (and the associated degrees of freedom) from this. For any main effect or interaction, we count the number of instances of this particular (e.g., 10 for the interaction between position and adaptation). We subtract the number of mean parameter used to estimate means and differences in mean (1 global mean, 4 means for position, 1 for adaptation), which gives $4=10-6$ degrees of freedom. Next, this term is compared to the mean square which contains only subject (here via acuity levels, since subjects are nested within acuity) and the corresponding variables; the correct mean square is for `acuity:adaptation:position`. In the balanced design setting, this can be formalized using Hasse diagram [@Oehlert:2010]. \n\nWe can produce an interaction plot to see what comes out: since we can't draw in four dimensions, we map visual acuity and adaptation level to panels and use different colours for the position. The figure looks different from the paper, seemingly because their $y$-axis is flipped.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='09-repeated_cache/html/fig-LBJ-interactionplot_7ad8280d76cd753f84705fe6cf100a92'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Interaction plot for visual acuity levels.](09-repeated_files/figure-html/fig-LBJ-interactionplot-1.png){#fig-LBJ-interactionplot fig-align='center' width=85%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n## Multivariate analysis of variance\n\nThe second paradigm for modelling is to specify that the response from each subject is in fact a multivariate object: we can combine all measurements from a given individual in a vector $\\boldsymbol{Y}$. In the example with the happy fakes, this would be the tuple of measurements for (`real`, `GAN1`, `GAN2`).\n\nThe multivariate analysis of variance model is designed by assuming observations follow a (multivariate) normal distribution with mean vector $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_j$ in group $j$ and common covariance matrix $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ and comparing means between groups. As in univariate analysis of variance, the multivariate normal assumption holds approximately by virtue of the central limit theorem in large samples, but the convergence is slower and larger numbers are needed to ensure this is valid.\n\nThe difference with the univariate approach is now that we will compare a global mean vector $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ between comparisons. In the one-way analysis of variance model with an experimental factor having $K$ levels and a balanced sample $n_g$ observations per group and $n=n_gK$ total observations, we assume that each group has average $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_k$ $(k=1, \\ldots, K)$, which we can estimate using only the observations from that group. Under the null hypothesis, all groups have the same mean, so the estimator is the overall mean $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ combining all $n$ observations.\n\nThe statistic is obtained by decomposing the total variance around the global mean into components due to the different factors and the leftover variability. Because these equivalent to the sum of square decomposition results in multiple matrices, there are multiple ways of constructing test statistics.  Wilk's $\\Lambda$ is the most popular choice. Another common choice, which leads to a statistic giving lower power but more robust to departure from model assumptions is Pillai's trace.\n\nThe MANOVA model assumes that the covariance matrices are the same within each experimental condition. Under normality assumption, we can use Box's $M$ statistic to test the hypothesis.\n\n\n\n### Data format\n\nWith repeated measures, it is sometimes convenient to store measurements associated to each experimental condition in different columns of a data frame or spreadsheet, with lines containing participants identifiers. Such data are said to be in **wide format**, since there are multiple measurements in each row. While this format is suitable for multivariate models, many statistical routines will instead expect data to be in **long format**, for which there is a single measurement per line. @fig-longvswide illustrates the difference between the two formats.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='09-repeated_cache/html/fig-longvswide_81113ab32d1a254966565759b5b25269'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Long versus wide-format for data tables (illustration by Garrick Aden-Buie).](figures/original-dfs-tidy.png){#fig-longvswide fig-align='center' width=85%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIdeally, a data base in long format with repeated measures would also include a column giving the order in which the treatments were assigned to participants. This is necessary in order to test whether there are fatigue or crossover effects, for example by plotting the residuals after accounting for treatment subject by subject, ordered over time. We could also perform formal tests by including time trends in the model and checking whether the slope is significant. \n\n\nOverall, the biggest difference with within-subject designs is that observations are correlated whereas we assumed measurements were independent until now. This needs to be explicitly accounted for, as correlation has an important impact on testing as discussed @sec-modelassumptionsindependence: failing to account for correlation leads to $p$-values that are much too low. To see why, think about a stupid setting under which we duplicate every observation in the database: the estimated marginal means will be the same, but the variance will be halved despite the fact there is no additional information. Intuitively, correlation reduces the amount of information provided by each individual: if we have repeated measures from participants, we expect the effective sample size to be anywhere between the total number of subjects and the total number of observations.\n\n\n### Mathematical complement\n\n\nThis section is technical and can be omitted. Analogous to the univariate case, we can decompose the variance estimator in terms of within, between and total variance. Let $\\boldsymbol{Y}_{ik}$ denote the response vector for the $i$th observation of group $k$; then, we can decompose the variance as\n\\begin{align*} &\n\\underset{\\text{total variance}}{\\sum_{k=1}^K \\sum_{i=1}^{n_g} (\\boldsymbol{Y}_{ik} - \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}})(\\boldsymbol{Y}_{ik} - \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}})^\\top} \\\\\\qquad &= \\underset{\\text{within variance}}{\\sum_{k=1}^K \\sum_{i=1}^{n_g} (\\boldsymbol{Y}_{ik} - \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_k)(\\boldsymbol{Y}_{ik} - \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_k)^\\top} + \\underset{\\text{between variance}}{\\sum_{k=1}^K n_g(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{k} - \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}})(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_k - \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}})^\\top}\n\\end{align*}\ndefining covariance matrix estimators. If we write $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_T$, $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_W$, and $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_B$ for respectively the total, within and between variance estimators, we can build a statistic from these ingredients to see how much variability is induced by centering using a common vector. When $K>2$, there are multiple statistics that be constructed, including\n\n- Wilk's $\\Lambda$: $|\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_W|/|\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_W + \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_B|$\n- Roy's maximum root: the largest eigenvalue of $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_W^{-1}\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_B$\n- Lawley--Hotelling trace: $\\mathrm{tr}(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_W^{-1}\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_B)$\n- Pillai's trace: $\\mathrm{tr}\\left\\{\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_B(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_W +\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_B)^{-1}\\right\\}$.\n\nAll four criteria lead to equivalent statistics and the same $p$-values if $K=2$.\n\nWith a two-way balanced MANOVA, we can perform simlar decomposition for each factor or interaction, with \n$$\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_T = \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_A + \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_B + \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_{AB} + \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_W.$$\n\nWilk's $\\Lambda$ is based on taking the ratio of the determinant of the within-variance and that of the sum of effect-variance plus within-variance, e.g., $|\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_{AB} + \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_W|$ for the interaction term. \n\n### Model fitting\n\nWe can treat the within-subject responses as a vector of observations and estimate the model using using multivariate linear regression. Contrary to the univariate counterpart, the model explicitly models the correlation between observations from the same subject.\n\nIn order to fit a model with a multivariate response, we first need to pivot the data into wider format so as to have a matrix with rows for the number of subjects and $M$ columns for the number of response variables. \n\nOnce the data are in a suitable format, we fit the multivariate model with the `lm` function using the sum-to-zero constraints, here imposed globally by changing the `contrasts` option. Syntax-wise, the only difference with the univariate case is that the response on the left of the tilde sign (`~`) is now a matrix composed by binding together the vectors with the different responses.\n\n:::{ .example name=\"Happy fakes - multivariate\"}\n\nWe use the data from Amirabdolahian and Ali-Adeeb (2021), but this time treating the averaged repeated measures for the different stimulus as a multivariate response. We first pivot the data to wide format, then fit the multivariate linear model.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='09-repeated_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-14_e772bfe52714208d4343dacf18d73693'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Pivot to wide format\nAA21_mw <- AA21_m |>\n  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = stimulus, # within-subject factor labels\n                     values_from = latency) # response measurements \n# Model with each variable with a different mean\n# Specify all columns with column bind \n# left of the ~, following \noptions(contrasts = c(\"contr.sum\", \"contr.poly\"))\nmlm <- lm(cbind(real, GAN1, GAN2) ~ 1,\n          data = AA21_mw)\n```\n:::\n\n\nSince the within-subject factor `stimulus` disappeared when we consider the multivariate response, we only specify a global mean vector $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ via `~1`. In general, we would add the between-subject factors to the right-hand side of the equation. Our hypothesis of equal mean translates into the hypothesis $\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = \\mu\\boldsymbol{1}_3$, which can be imposed using a call to `anova`. The output returns the statistic and $p$-values including corrections for sphericity.\n\nWe can also use `emmeans` to set up post-hoc contrasts. Since we have no variable, we need to set in `specs` the repeated measure variable appearing on the left hand side of the formula; the latter is labelled `rep.meas` by default.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='09-repeated_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-15_881acbf9bc7fa710967f56c6f0efbebc'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Test the multivariate model against\n# equal mean (X = ~1)\nanova(mlm, X = ~1, test = \"Spherical\")\n#> Analysis of Variance Table\n#> \n#> \n#> Contrasts orthogonal to\n#> ~1\n#> \n#> Greenhouse-Geisser epsilon: 0.7565\n#> Huynh-Feldt epsilon:        0.8515\n#> \n#>             Df   F num Df den Df Pr(>F) G-G Pr H-F Pr\n#> (Intercept)  1 0.5      2     22  0.615  0.567  0.587\n#> Residuals   11\n# Follow-up contrast comparisons\nlibrary(emmeans)\nemm_mlm <- emmeans(mlm, specs = \"rep.meas\") \nemm_mlm |> contrast(method = list(c(1,-0.5,-0.5)))\n#>  contrast         estimate    SE df t.ratio p.value\n#>  c(1, -0.5, -0.5)   -0.202 0.552 11  -0.366  0.7210\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can check that the output is the same in this case as the within-subject analysis of variance model fitted previously with the `afex` package.\n:::\n\n:::{ .example name=\"Teaching to read\"}\n\nWe consider a between-subject repeated measure multivariate analysis of variance model with the @Baumann:1992.

The central limit theorem can be applied to a multivariate response, but the sample size needed overall to reliably estimate the correlation and variance is larger than in the univariate setting. This hypothesis can be tested using the Shapiro-Wilk normality test (null hypothesis is that of normality) by passing the residuals of the multivariate model. Such a test can lead to rejection of the null hypothesis when specific variables are far from normal, or when the dependence structure isn't the one exhibited by a multivariate normal model. With decent sample sizes (say $n=50$ per group), this assumption isn't as important as others. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='09-repeated_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-19_1ba0127381aa2313b626c55b4f75abd5'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n# Must transpose the residuals \n# to get a 3 by n matrix\nmvnormtest::mshapiro.test(U = t(resid(mmod)))\n#> \n#> \tShapiro-Wilk normality test\n#> \n#> data:  Z\n#> W = 1, p-value = 0.06\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe second assumption is that the covariance matrix is the same for all individuals, regardless of their experimental group assignment. We could try checking whether a covariance model in each group: under multivariate normal assumption, this leads to a test statistic called Box's $M$ test. Unfortunately, this test is quite sensitive to departures from the multivariate normal assumption and, if the $p$-value is small, it may have to do more with the normality than the heterogeneity.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='09-repeated_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-20_0db17f976b904fe1e0ca55b099ace6b8'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwith(BSJ92, \n     biotools::boxM(\n       data = cbind(posttest1, posttest2, posttest3),\n       grouping = group))\n#> \n#> \tBox's M-test for Homogeneity of Covariance Matrices\n#> \n#> data:  cbind(posttest1, posttest2, posttest3)\n#> Chi-Sq (approx.) = 15, df = 12, p-value = 0.2\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn our example, there is limited evidence against any of those model assumptions. We should of course also check the assumptions of the analysis of variance model for each of `postest1`, `posttest2` and `posttest3` in turn; such a check is left as an exercice to the reader.\n\n### Power and effect size\n\nSince all of the multivariate statistics can be transformed for a comparison with a univariate $\\mathsf{F}$ distribution, we can estimate partial effect size as before. The package `effectsize` offers a measure of partial $\\widehat{\\eta}^2$ for the multivariate tests.^[I must confess I haven't checked whether the output is sensical.]\n\nPower calculations are beyond the reach of ordinary software as one needs to specify the variance of each observation, their correlation and their mean.
