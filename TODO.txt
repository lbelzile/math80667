Principles of the design of experiment

- Experimental versus observational
- Experimental unit versus observational unit
- Variable versus observation
- Link with causal inference
- Classifying variables by type: response, explanatory and nuisance/controls
also variable type: continuous/discrete response, or categorical

Sampling strategies: simple, stratified (men/women), cluster (classes)
  - How do we go about handling controls (by design via blocking or by randomization)

Types of sampling bias: non-response, convenience, etc.
  - the case against online surveys
  - thinking about what are potential nuisance
  - impact of nuisance
  - What is randomization design
Terminology: placebo, blinding, double blind.

Causal inference and DAGs
Confounders versus colliders

Sources of variability:
- Populations and random sampling
  - why we cannot collect data on everyone: illustration from the census.
- Idea is to summarize/compress information
- there is inherent variability
- the validity of the conclusion depends crucially on the validity of the sample
- e.g. of ordering for AB testing, paired samples
- Generalizing the findings: from sample to population

Preliminary runs and how to make sense of them


The marketing department wants to know the value of its brand by determining how much more customers are willing to pay for their product relative to the cheaper generic product offered by the store. Economic theory suggests a substitution effect: while customers may prefer the brand  product, they will switch to the generic version if the price tag is too high. To check this theory, one could design an experiment.

As a researcher, how would you conduct this study? Identify a specific product. For the latter, define

- an adequate response variable
- the experimental unit
- potential confounding variables that would need to be accounted for.
