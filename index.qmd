This book is a web complement to MATH 80667A *Experimental Designs and Statistical Methods*, a graduate course offered at HEC Montr√©al in the joint Ph.D. program in Management.

The objective of the course is to teach basic principles of experimental designs and statistical inference using the **R** programming language. We will pay particular attention to the correct reporting and interpretation of results and learn how to review critically scientific papers using experimental designs.
The unifying theme of the book is that statistics are summary of evidence, and statistic as a field is the science of decision-making in the presence of uncertainty. We use examples drawn from published articles in management sciences to illustrate core concepts.
