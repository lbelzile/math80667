# Nonparametric tests

In small samples or in the presence of very skewed responses with extreme observations, the conclusions drawn from the $\mathsf{F}$ approximation to the analysis of variance model need not hold. This chapter presents **nonparametric tests**: these are procedures based on ranks that can be easily understood.

If our responses are numeric (or at least ordinal, such as those measured by Likert scales), we could compute ranks. These are the relative ordering in a sample, where rank 1 denotes the smallest observation and rank $n$ the largest. Ranks are not affected by outliers and are more robust (contrary to averages), but discard information.

SHOW EXAMPLE OF APPLICATION WHERE THE RESULT CHANGES.

The following tests are popular alternatives

- Wilcoxon's signed-rank test: an alternative to a one-sample t-test (also valid for paired measurements, where we subtract the two to get a single numeric number and we rank differences).
- Mann--Whitney $U$, aka Wilcoxon rank-sum test: the nonparametric analog of two-sample $t$-test, which ranks all observations in the sample and compares them between groups.
- Kruskal--Wallis test: analysis of variance model for the ranks, obtained by computing the ranks overall of the response and performing an ANOVA.

For more than 15 observations, the normal, student or Fisher approximation obtained by running the tests using the same ANOVA functions works.

More information about the null distribution and intuition. There are subtleties associated with ties and the zero-fudge (use `coin` package, discard zero differences for signed-rank test first and adjust sample size accordingly. For ties, we assign to the average rank, so 4, 2.5., 2.5, 1 if we have data (8,2,1,2).

Add two examples (`BRLS21_T3` uses signed-rank test, Bruck and Levav's eyetracker data in `BL22_E` uses Kruskal--Wallis). Show the $p$-values match up to rounding.
